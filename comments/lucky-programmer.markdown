    Great post! I am now on a job that is really testing my passion for
    programming (since I have the title of programmer but do little or
    no programming), but instead of just sulking and felling I am use
    that time when I am not doing anything to just relearn stuff I have
    forgotten and languages such as c++ or just hardware stuff.

    PS: What has the name “Cangaço”?? Is it your cms? lol Nice name

    A wonderful post! It beautifully captures the concepts behind the
    software industry, the industry of ideas. It is no longer a separate
    entity, but is increasingly a fundamental tool for all areas of
    research and business.

    @Antonio: yea, I’m afraid the odds are pretty bad out there when it
    comes to finding interesting gigs. I think it’s really important to
    be purposeful about finding something interesting though, maybe
    while you have a job anyway so there’s less pressure to accept
    offers. Or maybe start your own company
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    . It’s cool that you get to use some time to learn though.

    Cangaço is the WordPress theme

    hahah. I love Portuguese – we have some funny words huh? Impossible
    to translate to English. Like I told you by email, I’m working on a
    complete theme to use on the site. The current one is just minor
    adaptations.

    @Jack: thanks

    Yea, it’s already to the point where people in other fields who
    don’t program are at a serious disadvantage. When I hung out in the
    Chemistry/Bio departments, I was appalled at how much time people
    would lose because they lacked basic programming skills. In business
    it’s even worse – I’m afraid to think how much money we lose in
    productivity because people can’t script Excel.

    I think programming became a fundamental skill for most professions,
    but the educational system is lagging a bit.

    As you say, software is increasingly fundamental, and I expect a lot
    of interesting work ahead.

    @bruno: you see, I’m not the dark center of the universe like you
    thought

    This is, I believe, the first time I respond to a blog post I don’t
    know the author of. This was truly a great post. Probably the finest
    piece of blogging I have read lately.

6.  tv on July 15th, 2008 10:52 am

    Wow! Thanks for this great post. I am currently in one of those jobs
    that is “squeezing the fun out of everything” that I enjoy about
    programming. I’ve been wondering if it’s possible to have a
    programming job that allows me to enjoy the programming I do. You’ve
    given me more than a little hope for my future.

7.  Joshua Moore on July 15th, 2008 12:54 pm

    Great post! The only thing I worry about is your comment about the
    third world children. While I definitely agree with the sentiment, I
    was recently reminded that not everyone (even here) has meaningful
    access to a computer. So when we sing praise to the benefits of the
    personal computer to society, we should also take a moment and think
    about who is still left out.

8.  miran on July 15th, 2008 1:04 pm

    Very well written article, really sums up the whole deal really
    nicely! That’s pretty much exactly how I feel when I’m programming,
    it’s just so great when something you built works or when something
    that you’ve been trying to figure out just clicks. Or when you take
    a look at some really beautiful code you’ve written.

9.  brad dunbar on July 15th, 2008 2:57 pm

    To echo the sentiments above, this is a fantastic, inspirational
    post.

    When I finish a beautiful piece of code or module I feel that I have
    in some way transferred a unique piece of logic from my brain into
    byte code where it can be more freely shared.

    Posts like this make me question my assumptions and remember the
    reasons I love doing this. Thank you.

13. Terry on July 15th, 2008 4:11 pm

    I completely agree with you! Too often I catch myself whinging about
    some new problem that I have to fix, but if I think about it,
    solving problems is my bread and butter. I LOVE it! I’ve often just
    took a moment from what I’m doing to think “wow, I can’t believe how
    much I love this job” I actually have the privilege of coming in to
    work and thinking, which is more than I can say for a lot of other
    people.

    As for changes in biology, I would love to get into that area. I
    took a course on bioinformatics and it was really interesting. Great

16. Chris on July 15th, 2008 5:48 pm

    Im glad to be a programmer as well, but programming is not art. Of
    course you could use programming as a medium to create art, but we
    are talking about software development. A craft for sure, but art is
    about either expression. Software development is about
    functionality.

    Calling it art gives people who don’t understand how it is creative
    amo to attack it and perpetuate the belief that it is ‘just math and
    typing’.

17. [Niilo](http://www.upsidedowndog.com/) on July 15th, 2008 6:16 pm

    You’ve put down in your post the sentiments I’ve been trying to get
    across to people for years. I’ve always considered programming as
    much an art form as any other creative outlet. I love being given a
    challenge and the feeling of pride that comes with the solution.
    Only another programmer can truly understand what it means to shave
    a few cycles off a loop or come up with a new algorithm that’s one
    line less than the last version. I get an immense sense of
    satisfaction from my chosen career, and as you, I feel lucky to be
    able to do what I do.

    I recently left my job because it was killing the love I have for my
    work and I couldn’t stand it. The “business” and stress of a job has
    a way of destroying the creative spirit and I’m taking a couple of
    months off to recharge and get that spark back. My career as a
    programmer grew out of a hobby – I bought my own computer in 1981
    and taught myself how to program and never looked back – so finding
    myself hating what I was doing was horrible and soul destroying.

    A lot of people see us as nerds and geeks without lives and without
    emotions, but the emotion is there, the love is there, and the
    creativity is there. We just use ones and zeros instead of paint and
    canvas.

    Reading your post, I was just amazed at how much I agreed with you.
    I am fortunate enough to have left Graduate School (I was working on
    a Ph.D. in Pharmacology) to start a career in Programming. I have
    mostly worked for myself, but have had crappy (and not so crappy)
    corporate Jobs as well.

    I have had the same experience myself, both in Science and as a
    Programmer. Never have a read something that hit so close to the way
    I feel on a topic. Thank-you, and I hope you will find more of the
    same in your new career, no, I am sure you will, so enjoy it.

23. Matt Sisk on July 15th, 2008 9:28 pm

    To Chris –

    The interesting bit is that software development is both things,
    both instruction set and creative act. Here are a several analogies
    to consider:

    ​1) scores — nobody doubts the artistry of writing down instructions
    for producing beautiful results in music; composers are considered
    artists as well as those that perform, interpret, and modify the
    results. The same is true of lyricists/songwriters — they are poets,
    but the results are wonderful mulch for performers.

    ​2) recipes — see above, chefs and brilliant cooks, presentation,
    etc — but the recipe itself can have inherent beauty, particularly
    if it is embellished with non-obtrusive anecdote, which invokes
    prose, and also takes us to …

    ​3) poetry — avoid these; poets that recite their verse in public
    may have other nasty habits (paraphrase of Lazarus Long from
    Heinlein)

    ​4) satire — of course I’m kidding with my last point, though I
    doubt the character of Lazarus Long was

    ​5) engineering — just as bridges, watches, and architecture can
    have aesthetic beauty, so can code — it’s helpful if the beauty is
    more accessible, such as with great architecture, a visual punch in
    the pleasure ganglia, but beauty can exist in design, forever unseen
    by untrained eyes. And thus:

    ​6) nature — the elegance (and disarray, sometimes) of natural
    responses to environmental stimuli have an endless array of innate
    beauty, at least as perceived by natural-born critics.

    Cheers,\
     Matt

24. Chris on July 15th, 2008 9:29 pm

    Art is about self expression. Programming is about functionality!!!

    Why must everyone think that they are an artist??? I am a programmer
    and a musician. Yes, programming is creative. No it is not an art.
    Programmers are no more artistic than machinists, carpenters, or
    mechanical engineers. Programming is great, I love it too. Just be
    happy with what it is, stop trying to make it more.

25. Chris on July 15th, 2008 9:43 pm

    To Matt:

    Thanks for your response. My last post wasn’t to you, it was a
    general reaction to other posts.

    I don’t consider Chefs or Engineers artists and I certainly don’t
    consider nature art.

    To me art is about self expression. There is definitely aesthetic
    beauty in software (that only other programmers could ever
    appreciate), but this still does not make it art. Painters,
    sculptors, and composers were considered craftsmen just like
    carpenters and blacksmiths up until the renaissances. The concept of
    an artists didn’t exists until the work became focussed on
    expression rather than aesthetics.

    An artists creates something that expresses an emotion and evokes an
    emotional response from those who experience it. I have never seen a
    piece of software that could meet my definition of art. Of course if
    a talented and artistic programmer set out to accomplish this they
    could, but those of us working in the industry are not artists.

26. jdzzle on July 15th, 2008 10:04 pm

    yeah, i can kind of tell that you’re probably either fresh out of
    college or still in college. i’m at the point where i kind of feel
    like the garbage man of software engineering.. “where do you want
    this sh\*t” “what kinda sh\*t you want in your program.” , “you want
    a what with what?”\
     i still enjoy the sh\*t, always have , always will

27. Wayne on July 16th, 2008 1:02 am

    Great post! I’m a software engineer now, used to be a pure
    programmer in previous jobs, but I think the way that you feel can
    be extended to any job. It’s all about finding the quiet joy and
    pride in whatever you do and to do it your way. That’s the only way
    to find happiness in your job.

    Thank you all for reading and for the comments
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    Reading them made my day.

    @Joshua: Totally agree. I’m from Brazil, so I’ve seen some pretty
    ugly realities up close. It’s easy to get carried away with the
    possibilities of Wikipedia or OLPC or whatever, yet there are plenty
    of people who haven’t touched a computer (or phone) in their lives.
    I actually spend a ton of time thinking about that, probably as a
    result of growing up in such a screwed up economy. However, I think
    the Internet also impacts those people in a positive way. I’ve been
    meaning to write about this, though it’s probably not postable here.
    If you’re interested, drop me an email at
    [gustavo-web@duartes.org](mailto:gustavo-web@duartes.org) and I’ll
    email you when I get around to writing some stuff down.

    @Chris: this is an old debate. Knuth wrote an interesting article on
    it, called ‘Programming as an Art’, which is available at Paul
    Graham’s site:
    [http://www.paulgraham.com/knuth.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/knuth.html).

    A while back I wrote about [Richard Feynman and software
    engineering](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/richard-feynman-challenger-disaster-software-engineering).
    In that post I talk about the similarities between software and
    other engineering disciplines.

    In a way this is a silly debate. Art is complex and hard to define,
    so is engineering, and programming is a rich and multi-faceted
    discipline. Some reasonable definitions of art match good chunks of
    programming. Some reasonable definitions of engineering match good
    chunks of programming.

    So, which is it? I don’t think there’s a black and white answer. You
    could certainly define each word to get a desired value for the
    truth, but given the loose nature of language I think ‘a little bit
    of both’ is a fair statement.

31. [Derek](http://www.harmonyfactory.com) on July 16th, 2008 1:58 am

    Wonderful post:

    I’m a little unsure about the “Take Biology.” paragraph. I suspect
    the perceived lack of progress stems from the complexity of the
    systems being studied, rather than inadequacy in the study. That
    said, the point you make that software can help here is well made.

32. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on July 16th, 2008
    2:10 am

    @Derek: absolutely. I don’t mean to say that biologists are buffoons
    that need the programmers to come and help. It’s the complexity of
    the system as you pointed out. But this need for computers in
    science, in areas where our brains flat out don’t cut it, that makes
    the future of software in science so interesting.

    In fact, some of the challenges in ‘biology’ \_are\_ physics /
    chemistry problems. For example, protein folding. Given the
    amino-acids in a protein, it’d be dandy to know what three
    dimensional shape it will take once built in a cell. This is an
    atomic / molecular issue, so it’s fair to say it’s less biology and
    more the exact stuff which I say has ‘progressed’. Yet, it’s very
    complex and so far unhandled despite computers.

    wondering what courses you may have took in order to get a better
    understanding on biology and bio tech.

38. JY on July 16th, 2008 2:39 pm

    Matt reminds me that programming is creative, like other creative
    work: music composing, painting, I truly agree programming is art.

    Hard working, intelligence is a part of programming, that’s why
    people could see the beauty of code.

40. Matt Sisk on July 16th, 2008 11:03 pm

    Chris –

    I agree that the crux of this debate might hinge more on semantics.
    I definitely indulged in blurring ‘perceived meaning’ when I invoked
    ‘beauty’ (and awe-inspiring) vs ‘art’.

    Having said that, I’m left curious. From your point of view,
    focusing on the musician aspect, how do you classify the composition
    of scores, or lyrics, vs the actual performance of said music/poem?
    Are both acts art? Or is their a classical gradient here (subjective
    \*or\* objective … both are possible)?

    Cheers,\
     Matt

    Again, thanks everyone for the feedback!

    @Steven: My personal path was a bit twisted because my undergrad was
    math (focusing on computer science stuff) and premed. So I did
    ‘classic’ stuff like organic/inorganic chemistry, biology, etc.,
    plus the computer/math stuff like algorithms, statistics, etc. But
    this is an inefficient way to go about it – you really don’t need
    too much formal coursework in chemistry/bio. Then I did a tiny bit
    of grad work, still in Math, where I took a Bioinformatics course.

    The field is pretty broad, so what exactly you need varies a bit.\
     There’s an open access journal at
    [http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/)
    which gives you an idea of what sort of stuff gets studied.

    On the bio side, understanding of genetics and cell biology is
    extremely useful, and something you’d have to learn from courses or
    from reading on your own (very doable).

    On the math/CS, there are lots of statistics (including Markov
    chains, Bayesian, Monte Carlo, lots of stats), machine learning,
    neural nets, algorithms, dynamic programming. I mean, there are so
    many areas in bioinformatics that it touches a bit of everything.
    Some examples:

    ​1. To work on sequencing, you want lots of statistics. You’re
    trying to match one sequence of nucleotides with another, computing
    how far apart they are, relative distances, etc. You might compute
    ‘genetic distance’ between species, or a single gene, that kind of
    thing. So lots of statistics, plenty of algorithms to deal with the
    problem.

    ​2. To work on protein folding is a bit different, there’s a lot of
    work in doing computer simulation of atoms and molecules to try to
    figure out how a protein might behave. Different bits of math and CS
    here, this is more like numerical analysis and more classic
    scientific computing.

    ​3. There’s a lot of machine learning to deal with the explosion in
    literature and information. You might use something like a
    parts-of-speech tagger to try to digest journal articles and
    automatically mine information from them.

    It goes on and on. I’m not an expert in the field by any stretch,
    but I hope this helps a bit. Best of luck.

    Great post. Truly inspiring. I am giving it to all my students to

    I have been in the industry since 1972 and I can never get bored.
    Life and work merge into one and every day brings a little bit of
    happiness. Some days are heady and you are in the zone. But it is
    always, always engrossing. In fact, I would recommend programming
    for fun as a way to boredom in the old age.

    I am like the Ancyent Programmer described in this

    programming. After two year, there was almost no more programming.
    Yes, it seems institutions have a problem with that. Hopefully, that
    will change.

    Good luck!

    Well said!

    This essay echoes the sentiment of Andrei Ershov, expressed over 35
    years ago in an article entitled *[Aesthetic and the Human Factor in
    Programming](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=361454.361458)*:
    “To be a good programmer today is as much a privilege as it was to
    be a literate man in the sixteenth century.”

    Thanks for the feedback everyone.

    @spanky: I’ve done that in the past as well. However, it gets tough
    when you have a family and any other interests. I really enjoy
    reading and doing some non-computer stuff, time is at a huge premium
    for me right now, so if I can get some joy at work, that’s helpful.

    @Eric: that was an excellent read, thanks for posting it!

    @gaston: that’s a great point. Joel Spolsky had a good post on this:
    [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/01/08.html](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/01/08.html).

    I was myself a Math major, so I personally love the theoretical side
    of things, proofs, that kind of stuff. But it’s definitely not
    programming and I agree with the point both you and Joel make.

    @Roger: thanks for posting the article. I really liked it and I get
    a huge kick out of reading older computer science stuff.

    @Rodrigo: muito obrigado
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    E parabens pelo excelente trabalho com a Boo.

    @Martin: I make that same point with people all the time! There’s a
    strong tendency for people to think highly of what’s “old and good”
    versus the scary new stuff.

    Think about society. People are always saying how “things are
    degenerated now, whereas back in the day things were great.” I mean,
    WTF? Do they mean \~65 years ago when blacks were lynched, Jews were
    killed in ovens, women had separate job sections in the paper, and
    being gay was illegal?

    Come on. Things improve so much and so fast, it’s incredible. Ditto
    for the Internet. It’s the most positive thing ever to happen in the
    world. It’s an amazing wealth-distribution, economy-optimizing,
    information-sharing engine that will bring us untold benefits
    everywhere.

    And of course the medical & science stuff, a talking device for
    Stephen Hawkins, I mean, seriously. Everywhere you look. I’m a
    pretty skeptical person overall, I doubt things by nature,
    especially the conclusions I have reached. But on this front the
    evidence is overwhelming.

    Very well said. My employer very often makes me tired to technology;
    but nights & weekends, I code for fun. At work, everything MUST be
    over-engineered, simple solutions that work are frowned on if not
    outright banned. I often look at things we build and think – ‘I
    could have done that for 20% of what we spent.’ But they think
    because their business is big and complicated they’re technology has
    to be too. But the golden handcuffs make it hard to leave. The
    compromise? Open Source – by working on some open source projects, I
    find a release for that creative drive.

    I understand what your saying, but I don’t think it’s the
    corporations fault. Its the nature of software engineering.
    Engineers theses days must spend much time investigating, debugging
    and even testing. We spend more time analyzing, reading and
    investigating then coming up with solutions: this is the inherent
    falicy that everyone seems to misunderstand about the reality of the
    software engineering field.

    Thanks for the inspiration. I’m printing this one out.

70. Vik on July 26th, 2008 11:02 am

    I have been going up and down each day thinking if I can afford to
    leave a medicine career (I am a MD) and start from scratch as a
    programmer. Ofcourse, its not out of the blue and I am thinking of
    it because I have been learning and doing some programming in
    javascript and php as hobby.

    After reading this post and some of the comment one think I have
    understood well and that is that not everyone, even with years in to
    this profession, see it a way of getting a paycheck. There is more
    to what a programmer do and enjoy it for more that a means of
    getting a paycheck.

    I think I am not doing anything wrong. I am right in thinking that I
    should do what I enjoy more and not because I have already given
    year to medicine and that fact that most who are into programming
    started at very early age.

    I would be glad to hear from the author (and any reader) for their
    suggestion on my future plans. I am quite strongly thinking of
    programming as my new profession but still their are weak moments
    especially when people bring the fact that I can make much much more
    money in medicine and even at the acme of my career in IT I would
    make less than an avg medicine guy. I agree with this stark truth
    but cant get over the fun of writing code, the thrill of designing
    the webpage with an sprite image of 5-10kb placed smartly with css.

    I would appreciate if the author could provide me his email so that
    I can ask him for some more concrete advise.

    thanks all for such nice discussion.

71. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on July 26th, 2008
    1:32 pm

    Wow, this post really struck a nerve. Thank you all so much for the
    feedback.

    @Pascal: that is a very good point. I remember reading one Paul
    Graham essay where he talked about how one of his YC alumni went on
    to a big company, but a ‘good one’, and yet he still noticed how
    much his LOC / week decreased at the big co vs. the startup.

    It’s natural to just ‘blame the bureaucracy’ but you’re quite right,
    once software reaches a certain size and complexity changes become
    harder, not because of the institutional failings, but because the
    inherent challenges truly do shoot up.

    It’s one thing to blaze ahead when you have a 20k line codebase in a
    product that has never been in production. It’s another when you
    have 1M lines deployed in multiple versions, localized, having to
    maintain binary and interface compatibility, etc etc.

    However, I did factor that in when I thought about this piece. For
    example, look at the Microsoft of 10, 15 years ago. They worked on
    very complex products, but by all accounts it sounds like people
    were happy there and got a kick out of work. The Microsoft of today,
    not so much. The change was mostly institutional, or so it looks
    from the outside.

    I think software can be fun even in complex environments, in fact
    there are interesting challenges that \_only\_ arise there. But it’s
    up to the institution to get it right. Is it gonna be Peopleware or
    Pointy Haired Boss?

    @Vik: You can reach me at
    [gustavo-web@duartes.org](mailto:gustavo-web@duartes.org)

    I’ll write some thoughts here though so that it’s out in the open
    rather than locked in our mailboxes.

    Where do you currently practice medicine? Is it in the US? I spent a
    lot of time around American doctors, so I saw a lot of the burn out
    and challenges they faced.

    But I have to be honest with you, the “grass is always greener on
    the other side” effect is very strong. There was a lot of that going
    on for me when I was about to switch (into medicine away from
    computers). I was burned out, and medicine seemed like a good exit
    plan. When I thought more about it though, I realized that burn out
    would happen in any profession, and that in a way I was going about
    the problem the wrong way.

    I’ve been programming computers from a very young age, about 6, and
    since 12 I’ve been programming pretty seriously (in C and doing
    large programs). So I’ve loved the stuff from early on, and STILL I
    thought about abandoning it, and still I was burned out. Which tells
    me that, at least for me, no matter how much I like something burn
    out can happen.

    That’s partially why I wrote this post, for people who are now in
    the situation I was then.

    In my case I took some time off – a lot of time off, and when I got
    back I was 100% into it again. Even running a SQL query and watching
    the database give me back the rows was fun. I was then lucky to find
    a great group of people to work with. The idea of going through med
    school and residency seemed insane at that point.

    The joy you get out of programming as a hobby might or might not be
    there if you were to actually work on it. There are a lot of
    terrible, soul-crushing programming gigs out there. There are some
    good ones too. But then the same can be said for medicine. You might
    be in a group practice with a poor environment and squeezed by
    insurance companies, or you might have a nice position somewhere.

    That was a lot of writing and a lot of rambling. The point is this:
    we humans tend to overestimate the impact of radical changes in our
    happiness, thinking that if we take some plunge things will end up
    far better. I would caution you against leaving behind your medicine
    career. I would encourage you instead to seek changes within your
    career: take a sabbatical, look for a different job, maybe some
    lateral move within medicine, or even – who knows – a place where
    you might be able to use a bit of your programming skills within
    medicine.

    Then, if that doesn’t work, maybe the plunge is the right thing to
    do. The task would then be finding a good place to program at, or
    maybe start your own company, maybe using software to solve some
    pain point you know doctors have and selling it.

    I hope this helps.

72. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on July 26th, 2008
    1:41 pm

    @Vik: another option would be to practice part-time and do
    independent programming work on the side. That might be a good
    compromise.

    Regarding the early age thing, I don’t think it’s necessarily an
    issue. I am not sure where your programming skills are currently,
    but it might be worthwhile to read some prominent open source code
    to get a feel for what decent-quality (or at least
    production-quality) code looks like.

    In my case I assure you I’m no programming superstar. I have decent
    talent with it, nothing great, but I love it and I try hard.

73. Sunkist on July 27th, 2008 10:02 pm

    I remember the days when staying up late and working hard, focusing
    on one task or problem or project was a lot of fun. Unfortunately
    over the years my employer has sucked that joy completely out of me.
    I’m looking forward to getting it back when I quit and start my own
    business with some others.

    Good post!

74. Benjamin on July 27th, 2008 11:59 pm

    I am an amature programmer who is currently just programming for
    myself and I cant agree more with what you have said, people around
    me cant understand why I would want to spend long periods of time
    programming as they see anything similar as work and therefore not
    worth doing on time off but its enjoyable to solve the problems and
    create something that works well and is nice a simple.

    Lucky to be a programmer.

    Question: How lucky will you be when you reach an age past 45 and
    jobs will be refused to be given to you due to your age?

    Better find a second alternative by the time you get to your 45′s +
    years old.

    The current technology won’t help you much 25 years down the road.

    I’ve been in system programming for 30+ years and I know what I’m

86. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on July 29th, 2008

    @John: my mother in law started programming in Java at \~50 years
    old, transitioning from a totally non-IT-related career. Female, 50,
    and she’s been pretty happily employed since (was about 6 years
    ago). Anecdotal, to be sure, but I know several people over 40
    programming.

    I think there are plenty of other careers that are even riskier to
    get old in.

    But the bottom line is: plan for your future, don’t trust your
    paycheck to last for ever. Live below your means, invest, sell a
    startup, do what you need to. There are a lot of other reasons you
    don’t want to depend on a paycheck anyway.

91. Jef on July 30th, 2008 6:10 pm

    Your post was a breath of fresh air. I give new programmers that
    come onto my team a similar speech on their first day. I take them
    out to lunch, one and one, and ask them to describe their choice to
    program professionally. I have not tired of “turning the switch”
    inside of people who begin by shrugging at it as a means to an end,
    but end by saying “Wow, I never thought of it that way.

    Somewhere near the beginning of my “speech”, I ask them to define
    art. Most people provide examples of definition (painting,
    sculpture, etc.). What makes them art?, I ask. Eventually, the
    conversation boils down to realizations such as:

    - Art is more than the sum of its parts\
     - Art is the intangible taking form\
     - Art is something created from nothing\
     - Art is anything that changes the way you feel or think about
    something

    Programming, indeed all of Computing Sciences — heck, the entire
    field of study of Mathematics — has a reputation of being cold,
    unimaginative, and monotonous. However, I challenge anybody to
    differentiate it from the most magical and colourful of arts!

    We create things from \*literally\* nothingness. We do not even use
    raw materials such as paint, a canvas, our bodies, or the pages of a
    book. Our art is closer to music, in that we require instruments to
    create our work on a “canvas of silence” (as my old high school
    conductor used to say).

    We take nothingness: barely detectable voltage differences in a
    microscopic transistor, and give it form. Our works appear to have
    shape & form, and our audience feels entranced enough to reach out
    and interact with it; to touch it and say “it’s here, it’s ‘this’
    wide, and that’s ‘below’ it” etc. It’s given tangible appearance,
    but still and always, it is nothingness. It never reaches the
    tangible form of a sculpture or painting. Like music, it ceases to
    exist except in our memories and imaginations once the instruments
    are packed up.

    We are artists of ideas. We take an idea and care for it and grow it
    the way a composer does a musical theme. We compose overtures of it,
    variations of it, and finales. We fret particularly about
    instrumentation! Where a composer worries about whether the low
    brass have enough weight to carry the foundation of the theme
    through the next phrase, we worry about the roles of so many peices
    of architecture and how they interact and hand off messages
    seamlessly and eloquently to one another.

    Our audiences experience our smoke-and-mirror show as realness. We
    have created a world out of nothing but our ideas, and we take them
    by the hand. If we’re lucky, we change the way they think or feel
    about something along the way.

    It seems that you picked a good field for yourself. As a fellow
    programmer of nearly 30-years, I have the same passion as I did
    creating my first BASIC program at my first job. I hope you keep the
    passion and fun.

    Every time you will walk down the street and see a good looking
    woman , you will feel pain in you stamach an bluch in your cheeks.
    You are a low value guy for her , and you know that.

    Your mindset is your prison ! Try living in the real world. Stop
    coming to this forum where another 10000 programmers give you
    validation. You are waisting your life.

    Watch “A beautiful mid” see how the genius tries to save himself
    from being a dorkish looser and leaves the academic world. Do not be
    a pathetic looser yourself , use you own head man !

    Every hour you work in front of the computer , the guy who pays you
    (owns you – for you are a slave) is making more money while youa re
    getting older.

    Thank you for writing this uplifting article. The love of the
    programming art and science is what started me on this career when I
    was a young teenager. Words like yours help to reignite the passion.
    Passion is key.

    The book Hackers by Steven Levy had a big influence on me too. It
    covers the time period when I began programming as a kid with my
    friends and shows what was possible back then.

    Guess what: Even more is possible today.

    I came to find out that math and the sciences are just as magic as
    any fantasy world I had ever read about.

    @Ed: The beauty of math and logic are overwhelming. How can one look
    at something like Cantor’s proofs and not be overcome by awe?

    This is a really amazing piece Gustavo. I got into programming very
    informally; totally self-taught, and I think one of the things that
    this process gave me was to have a particularly self-reflexive and
    analytical look at the actual process of coding. For some reason it
    just completely grabbed me, and I think that this is definitely
    because it is such an incredibly creative form of expression. I am
    always trying to explain just how riveting the process is – how
    stimulating it can be to come up with a way to do something, to
    solve those problems, to roll-out an idea. People take it completely
    for granted that there is such a vast amount of thinking that goes
    into the design and development of any kind of programmed thing, and
    yet your coding IDE is a tabula rasa for some of the most
    exhilarating and creative moments you can have. From architecting to
    development to testing, and let’s be honest, debugging even has it’s
    moments, programming is a total rush. Thanks for this post, it puts
    into words so clearly the thoughts I myself have about coding. (and
    yes, to one of the posters above, I also love the WordPress line
    “Code is poetry” – it’s great!)

    and I wanted more! Then once I taked this too far. 6 months projects

    static way of life. You get used to stress, you start to need it to
    do anything. You are no longer able to anything if it is not some

    It is true that in many organizations, programming is reduced from a
    fun task to something that must be done with metrics like lines of
    code which the management can gawk at and feel proud about.

    The true essence of programming is in building innovative creations
    by mapping ideas formulated in a mind to a real world solution.

    For me, programming is exactly how you describe it. Fun. I taught
    myself to write BASIC when I was 13 on a Commodore 64, and I knew,
    after I finally wrote my first application that I wanted to be a
    programmer.

    I really wanted to write video games (this was about when TRON was
    out), but found the complexities of dealing with graphics a bit too
    much for my wee little brain to handle. I found that my creative
    juices freeze up when dealing with graphics, so I have to farm all
    that creative stuff out, and leave myself to deal with the logical
    side of making everything work and do “stuff”.

    Great website! I think there are many valuable information and
    advices here. Along the same line, I came across the following
    website which I found interesting. Traditionally, personality tests
    such as MBTI have been used as career aptitude test. However, these
    tests have a very limited scope as they ignore many important
    factors such as person’s skills, values, and interests.

    There have been many advancements in the area of career aptitude
    testing. Usage of artificial intelligence to evaluate suitability of
    a job for a person is one of the these techniques. You can take a
    complete version of the MBTI personality test plus many others such
    as memory, IQ, problem solving, and patience tests in OptYourLife.
    This website’s expert system tries to find the most suitable career
    path for you using neural network. Moreover, salary of different
    careers will be considered in the final analysis to provide a more
    insightful advice for you:

    Hey Gustavo -

    I really wanted to comment and say that I identify so much with what
    you’ve written in this post. I’ve spent most of my undergrad career
    in neuroscience, which I found interesting but ultimately
    unsatisfying. Lab work is so tedious and takes months to produce a
    result. The summer before senior year, as I was preparing for my
    GREs, I realized that I’d be just as unhappy in grad school if I
    didn’t change things. I dropped my biochem courses, planned out a
    computer science minor (as I’d loved programming when I was younger
    and was eager to go back to it) and now I couldn’t be happier. I
    felt so at home in my classes, being around people who loved solving
    puzzles as much as I do, and the level of creativity and excitement
    is so much greater than in all of the courses I’ve taken in the
    natural sciences. I’ve also found that my abnormal background is
    actually a strength, and have had interesting bioinformatics
    opportunities since then. I honestly love being a programmer

    Great Post Gustavo – as someone looking into a career in programming
    it really inspired me.

    Quick question – what other ways are there to contribute and make a
    difference via programming? How does one get into programming
    projects that really help people – what sort of institutions are
    these things done at? Are they university projects, open source,
    private sector social-enterprise-type companies?

    I love the idea of developing the craft of programming, but also
    using it to do some real good.

144. Richie on March 25th, 2012 11:46 am

    Another question if you have the time to indulge me…

    What do you make of the current state of the industry/artform? I’ve
    heard it said that programming is becoming less about
    problem-solving and writing eloquent code, as it is about memorising
    wads of the latest libraries and frameworks and being good at
    mashing together various chunks of pre-written code.

    Do you think this library-explosion and abundance of pre-written
    code is changing the art form (or at least, the job description for
    most programming jobs?)

    I’m someone who gets real fulfilment from the problem solving and
    analytical sides. But if it’s really moving away from that, I’m not
    sure it’s really the right direction for me to pursue.

145. Aravind on April 2nd, 2012 7:25 am

    great post. “A non-math sort of beauty also exists in code,
    analogous to eloquence in discourse.” point well made. Super liked
    your article.

    Agree that programming, like you’ve said, involves craftsmanship,
    but I would like to make a finer point by comparing a programmer to
    a painter. Sometimes one is needed to paint a fine painting like a
    portrait and sometimes need to paint a uniform, spotless wall, both
    jobs involve a similar kind of effort from the two painters point of
    view and that both jobs have their own satisfactions, yet they are
    distinguishable based on the painters nature. Employ the wrong
    painter for the wrong piece of work and we don’t get what we expect.

    What a load of absolute tosh.

    Doing Software development for a living is like being plonked into a
    bucket of Diarrhoea on a daily basis. Each morning you kick your
    legs to stop from drowning, the best you can hope for is by the
    evening you’ve churned it into sh\*t (slightly easier to stand on
    but just as unpleasant to be around).

    Try writing web front ends to databases every day for 3 years, then
    see how much you think it’s creative beautiful art. Every day
    another repeat, and it’s not even a good repeat, it’s like a repeat
    of Nick Berry’s Heartbeat.

    Modern Software development is not engineering, nor is it science
    it’s being at the wrong end of the human centipede that is the
    modern development process. User eats the requirements, poos out to
    B.a., B.a. eats digests poo then poo’s out to Software engineer,
    Software engineer eats poo then produces final product.

    If you crashed in a plane on a desert island, software engineers are
    the second in the pot (the first being human resource people). Not
    that we are any more useful than HR people, they just tend to have
    more muscle tone due to not sitting in front of a computer in their
    spare time to keep up to date with the emperors new clothes that is
    modern frameworks.

    Glad you’re enjoying software development, but you are definitely
    wrong, programming == hell.

    Have to agree with Fat Mark (151).

    Having been in “software development” now for almost 20 years I can
    state without hesitation that it is a depressing, soul crushing
    experience, where the same tasks (and mistakes) are repeated project
    after project, year after year.

    Most of your colleagues will be socially retarded, point scoring
    cretins, blessed with little or no redeeming features.

    You talk of elegance and concise code but in the real world one is
    usually dealing with a spaghetti of example born code cut and pasted
    from Stackoverflow. “If it compiles it works” seems to be the motto.

    Oh aye, all the chicks (if you’re lucky enough to have any in your
    team) are munters!

    written by your team?” No? Me neither!

    Loved the post!

    This was a awesome expression of a feeling that I’ve had for ever,
    had have never been able to communicate to those around me. App
    Development is not geekiness… it is an art form… sculpting with math
    instead of chisels, on data rather than marble.

    People I work with, and live with, don’t understand sometimes that
    the creative fugue (‘haze’?) is a precious moment… and it is what
    people like us seek after and crave.

    Another point… watching users use… is like a playwright watching
    opening night. I remember, 20 years ago, watching a room full of
    operators using a interface package I constructed… and it was such a
    thrill it left me dancing in the aisle. I still love to watch the
    traffic monitor on an ecommerce site I created several years ago.

    Great article… thanks so much. I will be sharing, with co-workers
    and family members.

    Hey Fat Mark!! You’re either Michaelangelo, or a house painter. It’s
    up to you, and your skill, imagination, and confidence level are the
    only limiting factors.

    If you are unable build a better mousetrap, then be happy with what
    you have. If you are not allowed to build a better mousetrap, then
    move on!

    Great post, beeing a developer myself for about 24 years now I came
    across a lot of tasks. Right now working on a pretty complex
    invoicing automation system.\
     I do it together with an external developer who is highly creative,
    inspiring and gives me a lot of fun. This article exactly describes
    my current situation and legitimates what and WHY I’m doing this
    stuff. Probbably I’ll do such stuff for the rest of my live.

    Well said, nice post. As a project manager, I work with some
    brilliant software engineers and this seemed to hit home with all of
    them. We’ve discussed why they enjoy writing code and creating
    solutions and they echo your comments here. I can see their
    frustrations when it becomes a purely mechanical exercise devoid of
    anything other than production. My personal passion is in writing,
    mostly fiction but love all types- I love grammar, sentence
    structures, well-crafted story-telling, sophisticated but plausible
    plot architectures, solidly built character studies, etc.- and
    everything you wrote here strikes home with me.

160. [Dan Sutton](http://www.opwernby.com) on April 13th, 2012 9:05 am

    That’s right. That’s it exactly.

    Programming’ an interesting art form: it has an extremely limited,
    yet fanatical audience, and 99% of the people encountering the
    specific piece of art will fail completely to realise what it is.
    Write a program with 1000 features, one of which fails, and that’s
    the one you’ll get to hear about: the 999 which work perfectly will
    be ignored.

    In a sense, programming is a fundamentally thankless task; I think
    any programmer who engages a project solely with the aim of
    producing something the users appreciate is going to spend most of
    his career feeling somewhat disillusioned and let down.

    The true art is in the code; in the beauty of the algorithms and in
    the thought structures which underlie them: Dijkstra knew this and
    published books about it, all of which are worth reading at some
    point, when you feel like finding out what the founding fathers, as
    it were, used to think about.

    Being a programmer is not a career choice or a skill: it’s more than
    that: it’s a life choice: it informs everything you do and
    everything you are. I wouldn’t change it for the world.

161. Oscar on April 13th, 2012 9:25 am

    Holly cow! look at all of these posts, they are all agreed with the\
     feeling of all of us, the fellow programmers. well done tavo, the
    only other thing I can say is what Jim \#12 post here posted:\
     “Amen”

162. Fat Mark on April 13th, 2012 9:33 am

    Software development is not art.

    It’s a flow chart in text form.

    To claim otherwise is pretentious waffle.

163. KT on April 13th, 2012 9:56 am

    Creating software rocks. Those that don’t agree, don’t know or

    In some aspects I agree with Dan. The programs we create never seem
    to be finished and there is always a user, who wants one more thing
    added and/or one more thing changed and redone due to business logic
    changes or personal preferences. But, to get a program running
    successfully in production and have that program save time and/or
    money is the best feeling in the world.

    This does not only apply to programming but to the data as well. To
    have a database that is correctly normalized, with the correct
    constraints, and clean is a great feeling. To work on queries and
    reports where all of the numbers and data line up is just as
    fulfilling as a great algorithm.

    Of course, the slip side is just as stomach churning and nerve
    racking. I still get the willies when pushing a large program change
    into production and running a large update/delete query. I guess
    when that feeling goes away is the time to hang it up and find
    another profession.

    @Ahmed – I’m always amused by comments such as yours which basically
    boil down to “programmers are not sexy” because it indicates that
    you don’t know any actual women. Women list intelligence as the
    number one thing they are looking for in a mate, and this has been
    established by a good number of surveys and studies to the point
    that it’s no longer a theory, it is a biological fact about women.

    SO, I just have to point out, Gustavo’s eloquent, passionate writing
    is way more sexy than your brainless drivel. You didn’t even bother
    to use correct spelling, or capitalize \_your own name\_! Not sexy,
    not at all. And… Gustavo Duarte is a wicked sexy name just by
    itself.

    Programmers typically don’t have the raw physical sexuality that
    jocks have, but jocks typically don’t have the brain to keep you
    interested for a long term relationship.

    It seems you’re having some of the fun but not ready to accept it
    due to some social pressure to accept your middle class status …
    “when people hear about the crazy hours they often say they’re
    sorry. They really shouldn’t be. I would never do this often, or for
    long periods, or without proper \*\*compensation\*\*”?!!

    I’m doing this at least once every week for the last 25 years, and
    the most unpleasant thing is once in a while to receive the \$30
    payment some people think will “compensate” for my “56 hours without
    sleep work” …. My best \*\*compensation\*\* is to refund those guys
    their payment and never answer their messages …

    But I think there are a lot of folks out there that didn’t inherit
    their means of subsistence and would really need the \$30 some
    idiotic employer thinks a part of their soul is worth…. They are the
    true heroes of our world if they decide to follow the enjoyable path
    of our work and do their job professionally, regardless the
    \*\*compensation\*\* ….

    Great post! This evokes in me good ol’ Donald Knuth in his preface
    of “The Art of Programming”, where he states:\
     “The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is
    especially attractive because it not only can be economically and
    scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience
    much like composing poetry or music.”

174. Anonymous Coward on April 16th, 2012 4:16 am

    Meh, in a couple of generations programming will be as much part of
    your basic culture as writing became a hundred years ago, and as
    basic math is nowadays – if you won’t be able to do at least
    \_some\_ programming, you’ll be considered plain stupid.

    So hurry up, get the fun out of it while programming is still
    something special. It won’t last forever.

    @Fat Mark: sorry you’re so bitter, mate. You should take up
    Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Also snowboarding if you live near a resort. I
    think they might make you a happier person. BJJ surely would. After
    you’re happier, then you need to take a look at the profession and
    see if it might be time to change. Btw, your reference to “human
    centipede” was very funny, that’s got to be one of the most
    disturbed and funny movies I’ve ever seen. Especially the second

    had it in their status. Then — the violins started playing in the
    background and boom — I started falling in love with programming all
    over again. You’re right about employers sucking the joy out of it.
    After reading your blog, I’m going to do some soul searching to try
    to remember why I loved this thing in the first place.

    Fascinating…5 years later only proves that truths are timeless. But
    it does come down to who you work for (yourself or someone else,)
    how you view your situation and whether you can move on if
    dissatisfied. I have found after almost 30 years, that it’s the
    willingness to constantly relearn that makes it all what it is; if
    you don’t welcome that inevitable fact, you’re in the wrong place…
