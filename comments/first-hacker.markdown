    I think the definition of “hacker” should not be tied to computers
    or hardware.

    I use this word to describe someone who is very skilled in a field
    and can do all sorts of nifty tricks using non-standard approaches;
    devising these non-standard approaches implies that the person is
    intimately familiar with the low-level details of a problem in that
    particular field. (note how this is about devising your own
    approaches, not following steps described by someone else)

    For example, my father is someone I can call a
    “things\_with\_an\_engine-hacker” because he can tell whether a
    vehicle is working properly just by listening to it; moreover he can
    tell what the problem is by analyzing the “anomalies” in samples of
    the sound of the engine of the vehicle taken at various RPMs.

    In other words, there can be chemistry hackers, math hackers,
    photography hackers or [spoken] language hackers, etc. The term must
    be field-agnostic.

    Regarding taking sides (dark or light), “bad people” can be hackers
    too; therefore the term “hacker” should only tell us about one’s
    skills in a field, bearing no information about the colour of their
    hat.

    The media tends to apply the term to black-hats, we tend to say “the
    term is for white hats only”, because a truly intelligent person
    will never do harm. But this approach is not good, because quite
    often the line between good and evil is very blurred and each of us
    has their own definition for “evil” (as a function of religion,
    location, age, sex, nationality, etc).

    @Alex: that’s an \_excellent\_ point. Dropping the hat color from
    the word does indeed make a lot of sense. As you point out, the line
    is blurred – what are we going to use? A legal sense? Then how about
    repressive regimes, where Internet access or even more fundamental
    rights are forbidden? Was Phil Zimmerman a black hat? I wouldn’t say
    so, regardless of the trial outcome.

    I don’t agree about “truly intelligent” people not doing harm
    though. I think by reasonable definitions of intelligent,
    historically we’ve had many who did much evil (even using their own
    definition of it).

    Regarding the other fields, I think there’s a strong push, at least
    online, to generalize “hacking” right? I like that too, I think the
    word embodies a nice mixture of ingenuity and intellectual pleasure
    that is certainly cross field.

    Ultimately, the speakers in a language all decide what words mean.
    “Hacker” has come to mean both the black-hat and white-hat
    connotations.

    Actually, that’s probably as it should be. The term ought to be
    fuzzy because the concept is a bit fuzzy. What “white-hat” hacker
    hasn’t \*at least considered\* using some less-than-authorized
    technique to gain access to something, even if completely devoid of
    any malicious intent?

    In college, I did IT for the academic staff. I knew the passwords of
    at least 5 different professors, and two sysadmins. There were
    servers that I was not “allowed” to access as a part-time employee,
    but had to access in the course of my job. The “correct” method was
    for me to call someone up on the phone, have them enable access for
    20 minutes, and then do what I had to do. (Yay, bureaucracy!) Often,
    they weren’t around, which meant leaving a message and waiting for
    them to get back to me, only to find that the professor had taken
    their laptop home for the day. Frustrating.

    Changing the rule was not possible, so I decided to bump my
    productivity significantly by just shoulder-hacking a password, and
    doing what I had to do.

    I’ve also used my neighbor’s wifi (and in the process also protected
    them from malicious attacks that they were vulnerable to before.)

    Similarly, the term “hack” (as a noun) can mean either a brilliantly
    executed solution to a tricky problem, or an ugly half-assed patch
    job. These concepts are opposites. But they often look similar to
    one another. The thing that makes a hack brilliant is that it wasn’t
    obvious. If it was standard or pretty, you probably would have seen
    it already.

    Both the “tinkerer” and “cracker” meanings of “hacker” miss the core
    of the concept. “Hacker” captures what these two types of people
    have in common. There is a lot of overlap.

4.  [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on August 28th,

    @Isaac: I thought about the ambiguity in hack as a noun too. It’s
    interesting to think of it as a significant deviation from the
    quality/execution/expectation norm, one way or another. hahah. This
    has got to be one of the coolest words in English.

    Also agree on speakers deciding meaning, and the inherent fuzziness
    of hack.

    However I do think we can draw a pretty solid line on the blackness
    of break-ins. In your job situation there was a gray area, but by
    and large break-ins are plain wrong, imho, even if they’re the
    only-curious-maybe-delete-the-logs type rather than the rm-rf (or
    worse) type.

    I think it’s important to remove fuzziness from this area where we
    can, so that as people come into the programming/Internet scene
    there’s a clear standard that break-ins are wrong, period.

    Regarding common ground… Software cracking/reversing in general can
    require a lot of ingenuity and talent. So can complex break-ins and
    exploits. I mean, the recent DNS vulns, or a book like “Subverting
    the Windows Kernel”, heck, if those aren’t hacks what is? Because
    they are research, I see these as white hat endeavors, though some
    would disagree (fuzzy), but the same type of activity can be used in
    what is a clearly black-hat way in my book.

    So there’s common technical ground for sure, but the actions
    themselves, while they can’t be absolutely judged as Alex points
    out, are sometimes widely and unambiguously regarded as moral or
    immoral. Ehh, “widely and unambiguously” of course, hahah,
    implicitly calls for a well-defined group. It is not easy to speak
    of these things, no wonder Leibniz was after “symbolic thought.”
    Look, a three-headed monkey!

    It’s too much to ask of poor ‘hack’ though to embed all this
    judgment, so let it be fuzzy.

    I definitely agree on not tying hackers and computers/software
    together, and that reminds of what Bruce Schneier wrote in his
    [Secrets and
    Lies](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Secrets-Lies-Digital-Security-Networked/dp/0471453803/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220183318&sr=1-1):\

    @Oscar: That is such a great quote! Thanks for posting it. The only
    Schneier book I’ve perused is Applied Cryptography, maybe I should
    check out his other stuff. “Richard Feynman was a hacker” hahah, had
    I known that, especially right after posting about Feynman again,
    I’d have worked that quote in here

    i thought the term ‘hacker’ came from the tmrc, which pre-dates any
    of the computer uses of the term (and at least gives it white-hat
    historical origin).

    I’m afraid that those of use in the geek subculture don’t get to set
    broader linguistic usage. What you’ve described is the status of the
    word in this subculture but often words in a subculture can have
    very different meanings than they do to the broader society. For
    instance the term “inferior good” has a related but quite different
    meaning in discussions between economists than it does to the public
    at large.

    Frankly, if you look at broader usage patterns I doubt that the
    number of people who use hacker to mean anything *but* someone who
    breaks into computer systems will be exceptionally small. I mean
    hell a majority of the geeks I know tend to use hacker almost
    exclusively to mean someone who breaks into computers while
    occasionally, when the context is clear, using it to describe
    someone who makes hardware or software behave in some other fashion
    than it was intended.

    A word is just a sequence of sounds/letters. We need a word that
    describes people who break into computer systems and we also need
    one to describe more general tinkering and exploratory
    modifications. Given that we aren’t going to stop the widespread
    usage of the word hacker to mean the former, and even if we could it
    would be much effort, why bother trying. It’s not like there is any
    harm in just using some other term.

    I strongly disagree on your statement in “The MIT article dispels
    the common notion that “hacker” was a purely white-hat term later
    corrupted by the media. The black-hat connotation was there early on
    [...]“.

    This is nonetheless a potentially corrupted usage. If you take a
    second look and take into account the very period of time, it really
    sounds like a typical journalist interviewing a grumpy professor
    that calls those young pests hackers and whatnot, and then the
    reporter accepts it as reality. Notice that there’s no mention of
    any research or questioning any students – hackers or not.

    The exploit was a hack? Surely. Made by hackers? Most probably.\
     Does it define what a hacker is? Absolutely not. This might have
    been the only one hack with malicious consequences in the creator’s
    entire career(s).

    @Anonymous: that’s an interesting point. It’s true that the
    corruption of the term could have happened in the very first
    publication concerning “hackers.”

    However, the article does show that the black hat side \_was\_ part
    of our culture from the earliest times. That is really my point.
    People often whitewash that fact, and advance a history where we
    were all cuddly white hats for decades until some degenerates came
    along and gave us a bad name in the press. That’s not the case at
    all. Black hat stuff has always been a part of hacking.

    Of course the media \_did\_ corrupt the term. They did so in the
    other direction, painting us all as black hats and missing the
    nuance and complex nature of hacking.
