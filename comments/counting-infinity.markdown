    Great article, I wish I were your math-student; I missed some things
    in school, the void remained there and took its toll on my
    high-school performance, and that propagated to the university as
    well.

    I keep filling that void, but I know that there is so much stuff out
    there that is “too high-tech for me”. If you intend to continue this
    series, there will be a guaranteed audience of \>=1 readers (-:

    Extremely interesting! Had to read it about 6 times to follow, but
    that’s because I’ve been reading too many comics lately and not
    enough good stuff. Found your blog after linked in Lifehacker (I
    believe?) and have been loving it since. Keep up the great work!

    @Alex: sounds good. I’ll keep throwing in math stuff into the mix. I
    want to add more CompSci stuff anyway.

    @Matt: welcome to the ranks
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    I really enjoy Math and CS, doing it, learning it, teaching it,
    anything. In fact, not just Math and CS, but anything analytical is
    pretty fun as well.

    However I do get an extra kick from teaching because I think it’s
    such a positive thing to do in the world, whereas I can’t say the
    same about my paid computer work, and lately this has been on my
    mind (a la Tim O’Reilly’s [Work on stuff that
    matters](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html)).

    I’d like to move towards aligning my work with my ideals. But \$ is
    a factor, as an independent developer my pay is well above what I’d
    get teaching, for example. We’ll see how it goes.

12. [Drew](http://sealedabstract.com) on January 19th, 2009 2:59 am

    Great article. I’m not convinced by this line in your proof:\
     The digits of this number p are random and go on infinitely; it is
    a real number.

    I agree that p can’t be in the list because we have constructed it
    such that it is not real. I fail to see any property of p that would
    require it to be real. So I reject the contradiction on the grounds
    that p is not a real number.

    To complete the contradiction, you should trace its realness back to
    one of the real number construction methods
    ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction\_of\_the\_real\_numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers)).
    I’m not sure that that’s possible, because I suspect p is non-real.
    Not a mathematician though

    Hi Gustavo, I just wanted to commend you on doing a fantastic job on
    this writeup. I’m a big fan of clear, intuitive explanations and I
    think approaching topics with analogies & humor is a great tactic.
    I’ve been personally interested in understanding infinity better,

    I would recommend watching Dangerous Knowledge:
    [http://www.google.com/search?q=Dangerous%20Knowledge](http://www.google.com/search?q=Dangerous%20Knowledge)
    – it’s a BBC documentary on the fathers of modern mathematics:

    “In this one-off documentary, David Malone looks at four brilliant
    mathematicians – Georg Cantor, Ludwig Boltzmann, Kurt Gödel and Alan
    Turing – whose genius has profoundly affected us, but which
    tragically drove them insane and eventually led to them all
    committing suicide.”

    Thank you all for the feedback.

    @Drew: That is a really smart observation. In other uses of
    diagonalization, people make arguments very much like what you just
    made. For example, Turing does \_exactly\_ what you did with
    computable numbers by building a diagonal off a list of computable
    numbers, getting a resulting number, and showing that the resulting
    number is not computable.

    However, in this specific case, by definition our number \_is\_
    real. Here is what you said:

    > I fail to see any property of p that would require it to be real.
    > So I reject the contradiction on the grounds that p is not a real
    > number.

    My question to you would be this: if p is not real, then what is it?
    Is there some other set you’re proposing?

    It turns out that due to the way the reals are \_defined\_, they
    must contain our number, and any other number like it. If you write
    a program to generate a number whose digits are completely random,
    using a natural source for random bits, the result \_by definition\_
    is a real number.

    So basically, ‘every number is in the reals’, unless it’s imaginary
    ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary\_number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number)).
    This is a crude way of expressing it of course, but it follows from
    the precise definitions of the reals.

    The definition in question is that the reals are Dedekind-complete:
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind\_completion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_completion).

    Suppose our crazy random number P were NOT a real number. Then it
    would divide the reals in two sets, one set A of all reals less than
    our number, and one set B of all reals more than our number. But P
    itself would not be in A nor B. But this violates the property of
    Dedekind completeness, so P must be in the reals.

    @Kalid: your site rocks, I have read many of your articles as well.

    Again, thank you all for stopping by.

18. Doetoe on January 21st, 2009 4:22 am

    To Drew and Gustavo:\
     On the page mentioned by Drew\

    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction\_of\_the\_real\_numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers)\
     several constructions are mentioned from which it can easily be
    seen that p is (or rather defines a) real number:\
     one of the ways the real numbers are constructed is as equivalence
    classes of (or intuitively, limit of) Cauchy sequences of rational
    numbers. A sequence of decimal digits behind the decimal point
    really is (in this construction) the limit of its truncations, which
    is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. In fact, on that page it
    also mentions the construction as decimal expansions explicitly.\
     The construction by Dedekind cuts that Gustavo is referring to also
    is easy to apply: in this construction p stands for the Dedekind cut
    of the rationals defined as follows: given a rational number you can
    say whether it is greater or smaller than p by looking at its
    decimal expansion and comparing those (lexicographically).\
     Gustavo, I’m afraid your argument is not entirely watertight.
    Dedekind completeness means that if (A,B) is a Dedekind cut of the
    real numbers, then every real number is either contained in A or in
    B. If p is not a real number, there is no contradiction in p not
    being contained in either.

19. Doetoe on January 21st, 2009 8:11 am

    Correction: the last paragraph must be\
     If (A,B) is a Dedekind cut of the real numbers, by definition every
    real number is either contained in A or in B. If p is not a real
    number, there can be no contradiction in p not being contained in
    either.\
     (Dedekind completeness, meaning that B has a minimal element for
    every Dedekind cut, doesn’t enter the picture)

20. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on January 21st,
    2009 4:14 pm

    @Doetoe: thanks for stopping by. I’ve been meaning to get my math
    back in shape, so this is great discussion. Here’s a better write up
    on completeness and what I tried to say (but failed):

    The rationals, reals and complex numbers are all ordered fields,
    roughly because they meet some criteria when it comes to addition,
    multiplication, and the relation \< . So far so good.

    Now take a subset A of an ordered field F (eg, subset 0 to 2,
    inclusive, of the rationals). If we have an element u in F such that
    a \<= u for all a in A, then that element is an \_upper bound\_ for
    A. For [0,2], here are some examples of upper bounds: 2, 3, 2.5,
    1000, etc.

    But [0,2] has a special upper bound: 2. 2 is significant because it
    is an upper bound for [0,2] and it is \<= \_any other\_ upper bound
    of [0,2]. 2 in this case is a \_least upper bound\_ or \_supremum\_
    for [0,2].

    More generally, if A is a subset of ordered field F, s in F is a
    \_least upper bound\_ for A if and only if: 1) s is an upper bound
    for A; 2) s \<= t for all upper bounds t of A.

    Now comes the rub: an ordered field F is \_complete\_ if and only if
    every nonempty subset of F that has an upper bound in F has a
    supremum that is also in F.

    The rationals are NOT complete. For example, think of the subset of
    rationals A, x in A such that x \>= 0 and x\^2 \< = 2. This subset
    has plenty of rational upper bounds. For example: 1.5, 2, 300, etc.

    But it does NOT have a supremum in A. This is because fractions can
    always get closer and closer to the square root of 2, but they never
    reach it. So if you think you have a supremum s, it's always
    possible to come up with a fraction such that it is \> s and \< =
    square root of 2. Thus s wasn't a supremum after all. This can go on
    indifinitely.

    The reals, on the other hand, are complete. We define them as such,
    either directly or by defining another property that implies
    completeness. They are 'the' complete field, in fact, because any
    two complete ordered fields are isomorphic.

    So, in the case of the reals, this is what is going on: if the
    number p is NOT in the reals, I can define a subset A such that x in
    A: x \< p. A has upper bounds in the reals, in fact any x \> 1 is an
    upper bound for A due to how p was defined. However this subset does
    NOT have a supremum in the reals, because even though p is not in
    the reals, you can always approximate it a little further. But then,
    if this subset doesn’t have a supremum, the reals are NOT complete.
    This is a contradiction. Thus p is a real number, and it is indeed
    the supremum for A.

    So basically, that was a long way to say that by definition p is in
    the reals
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    And now I want to go to grad school. hahah. Maybe I should take
    analysis in the fall.

21. [Drew](http://sealedabstract.com) on January 21st, 2009 10:06 pm

    Let’s say we define the set of all p-like numbers S (where each kth
    digit is not the kth digit of the kth real).

    By the definition of the set S, to prove “p is real” it is necessary
    and sufficient to prove “S is the set of reals.”

    To undertake this task, we must do the following:

    ​1. Define a basic algebra on S.\
     2. Show the set S Archimedian\
     3. Show the set S complete.

    None of these are trivial undertakings. If even one of them falls,
    the entire system falls.

    What algebra are we defining in S? What would be the operation to
    add two elements of S, for instance? To multiply two elements of S?

    We can make S Archimedian easy enough, simply by using a left
    alphabetic ordering:

    1230…\
     …\
     1231…\
     …\
     1232…\
     …\
     1233…\
     …\
     1234…\
     …\
     1235…\
     …\
     1236…\
     …\
     1237…\
     …\
     1238…

    Proof by contradiction: this ordering is incomplete. Assume the
    ordering we’ve described is complete. In that case, each subset of S
    would have a least upper bound in S. We define such a subset to be
    the numbers in the ordering above. That is, for t element of S,
    1230000… \< t \< 12389999…

    At this point we would have to invoke a little algebra to get a
    least upper bound. Surprisingly, that upper bound would be the
    number q = 12390000… Since each subset of S has a least upper bound
    in S, and since q is the least upper bound, q must be in S \*

    However, by the definition of S, the kth digit cannot be some number
    k. Since we have accepted [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] in the 4th digit for
    elements in S, by the definition of S, there cannot exist some
    number in S with 9 in the 4th digit. Since q has a 9 in the 4th
    digit, it cannot be in S\*. Since q is in S and q is not in S, we
    have a contradiction. QED.

22. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on January 21st,
    2009 10:55 pm

    Drew,

    Here is what I think are the two problems with the proof:

    > Let’s say we define the set of all p-like numbers S (where each
    > kth digit is not the kth digit of the kth real).
    >
    > By the definition of the set S, to prove “p is real” it is
    > necessary and sufficient to prove “S is the set of reals.”

    The first problem is the notion of the ‘kth’ real. There’s no such
    thing, \_unless\_ the reals are denumerable. So you’d have to prove
    that first before evoking the notion of kth real.

    The second problem is stating that it is necessary to prove that S
    is the set of reals. It would indeed be sufficient, but it’s not
    necessary. S can be a \_subset\_ of the reals, hence not complete.

    In fact, if you define some function mapping the naturals to the
    reals, such that the ‘kth’ real makes sense (the function would be
    non-surjective, assuming Cantor is right) and proceed to build set
    S, you’re right that S would not be complete.

    That would not be due to the fact that the numbers in it aren’t
    reals, but just because S would be a subset of the reals that isn’t
    complete, much like the naturals or rationals.

    Great post, I’ve been meaning to read about infinities for a while
    but never found something this concise and understandable. I only
    have one addition: Where you say “It differs in at least one
    digit.”, it would perhaps be helpful to explain \*why\* this is so.
    It was not immediately obvious to me, and I had to look it up in
    Wikipedia.

    The answer, of course, is that if that number \*were\* on the list
    and was the Nth number, its Nth digit would be the red one, but we
    know that its Nth digit is different than the red one.

    Is this forum a gathering place of idiots? Cantor was a fool and so
    I am not surprised.

    Your (Cantor’s) argument is lame. Do you understand that by changing
    the elements on the diagonal that you still end up with a number
    that is in fact in the original list? This of course being true
    assuming that every real number in the interval (0,1) can be
    represented as a decimal…

27. Charles Ellmaker on October 27th, 2009 4:43 pm

    Gustavo -

    Excellent article. I’m not a mathematician but was introduced to the
    Cantor diagonal via Gödel, Escher, Bach. Anyway, I found in
    discussions with colleagues that it was necessary to be more
    explicit in the explanation. Something like:

    You take the digits on the diagonal in the table and construct a(n
    infinitely long) “new” number, which one assumes would be found
    someone in the infinitely long list of reals since all real numbers
    are in the table. However, now you change each digit in our “new”
    number by adding or subtracting one, etc., to make a new digit, and
    hence a new number. Strangely, that number is nowhere in the list.

    [Incredulity on the part of others. Huh? What?]

    Well, the new number is not the same as the first number in the list
    because the first digit is different.\
     It’s not the same as the second number in the list because the
    second digit is different.\
     …

    Anyway, I know that’s a bit long-winded, but most people need it
    spelled out explicity, at which point the light bulb goes on.

    Cheers,

    Charles
