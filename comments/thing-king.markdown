    I own that book, and I have to say it is one of the best books on
    memory and programming (even though specific to C) I’ve ever read.
    Great blog!

    Except the king can hardly tell which crate is the grubbiest.\
     If a crate is in the workshop already, simply zarking a thing in it
    won’t un-grubify the crate.\
     So all he has to go by is how long ago the crate was brought back
    from the warehouse.\
     Sometimes he does a little trick, he pretends the crate is away at
    the warehouse but actually it in the workshop. If someone tries to
    zark a thing in that crate, the king can tell that the crate is
    quite in demand.

    @R Caloca: I love the anecdotes and style on that book. Has that
    playful hacker attitude, very nice read.

    @Alex: HAHAHAH. Brilliant.

    Amazingly, I was just thinking about this story yesterday–I had read
    it back in the early 80s and was trying to remember the details.
    Thanks for posting it!

    Great post! I like the analogy game.

    From now on I’ll start using the new terms: crates, workshop,
    zarking and grubby when corresponding with our lead developer

    Great one indeed. Like Radu, and unlike the late Edsger Dijkstra (as
    exposed vehemently in his famous ‘On the Cruelty of Really Teaching
    Computer Science’\*), I also believe analogies often help a lot.

    Bruno, I agree with you on that one. Though analogies cannot be
    applied everywhere (especially in new, radical fields of science
    like Quantum Mechanics) we shouldn’t just discount their power,
    especially in the early stages of learning a new discipline.

    Loved this story in the 70s.\
     Recently I was telling a recent graduate (EE) about ancient large
    mainframes. He asked me what computers were used for in those days.\
     Just wanted to mention that in rule 12 it says:\
     “he first finds the grubbiest crate in the workshop … and packs it
    off with all its crate-mates to a warehouse”. Since he is talking
    about a crate and crates don’t have crate-mates, the phrase “with
    all its crate-mates” should be deleted.\
     Guess I’m obsessive.\

    wow. I’m at a loss for words at the content of your blog.\
     Truly great stuff – not just this post, but all of them. Kudos !

    Alex: There is another trick. Each location in the warehouse is
    equipped with a small candle, and whenever a thing within the crate
    residing in that location is zarked, the candle is lit. The Thing
    King can periodically arrange to have one of the table pages blow
    out some of the candles. If a candle remains unlit for some time,
    the things within that crate are obviously not in demand.
