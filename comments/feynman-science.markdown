    I’m 350 pages into James Gleick’s book “Genius: Richard Feynman and
    Modern Physics” and I can barely put it down. It’s a fascinating
    read and it’s really interesting to know more about him as a person
    and not only about his scientific contributions.

    Thanks for another great post.\

    Great post.

    OK, off to Amazon to buy this, and the book Claes recommends above…

    @Claes: Cool, I’m glad you mentioned this book, I’ll add it to the
    queue! I read Gleick’s book about Newton and it was a fun read. I am
    pretty ignorant about Feynman’s life actually, most of the stuff
    that I read from him was on science, and I didn’t read books about
    him. Thanks for stopping by.

    @TJIC: Thanks, and enjoy the lectures!

    @David: great clip. That is the Nova program with Feynman isn’t it?

    I’ve been trying to keep my blog posts small, so I kept stuff out of
    the post that I wanted to say real quick, so I figure I’ll post it
    in a comment. Here’s another quote from The Character Of Physical
    Law that I really like, p.127:

    “There is no reason why we should expect things to be otherwise,
    because the things of everyday experience involve large numbers of
    particles, or involve things moving very slowly, or involve other
    conditions that are special and represent in fact a limited
    experience with nature. It is a small section only of natural
    phenomena that one gets from direct experience. It is only through
    refined measurements and careful experimentation that we can have a
    wider vision. And then we see unexpected things: we see things that
    are far from what we would guess – far from what we could have
    imagined. Our imagination is stretched to the utmost, not, as in
    fiction, to imagine things which are not really there, but just to
    comprehend those things which \_are\_ there.

    (…)

    It will be difficult. But the difficulty really is psychological and
    exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to
    yourself, ‘But how can it be like that?’ which is a reflection of
    uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something
    familiar. I will \_not\_ describe it in terms of an analogy with
    something familiar; I will simply describe it.

    (…)

    On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands
    quantum mechanics. So do not take the lecture too seriously, feeling
    that you really have to understand in terms of some model what I am
    going to describe, but just relay and enjoy it. I am going to tell
    you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe
    she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful,
    entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can
    possibly avoid it, ‘But how can it be like that?’ because you will
    get ‘down the drain’, into a blind alley from which nobody has yet
    escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.”

    There are many other interesting bits as well, for example the
    discussion on how Maxwell relied on physical analogies and an
    imagined medium to build his EM theories. In fact, the text of
    Maxwell’s books is available online, and they’re fascinating to
    read. Maxwell’s books are second probably only to Newton’s in the
    history of physics, and that such a brilliant guy had to resort to
    physical analogies is illuminating and, in a way, comforting
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    Reading old science books in general is pretty instructive, maybe I
    should have stuck with the ether book after all.

    It was reading Feynman that I understood that science is limited to
    how, not why. Coming from computers it was hard because you can
    \_really\_ understand \_why\_ it all works the way it does (given
    enough time, of course, and there’s way more than we can know, but
    it’s possible to know why for a subset if you are so inclined).

    Not so in science. We have to be happy with \_how\_ it works, and
    often the how is an equation that cannot be readily rendered into
    English. Why is it like that? How \_can\_ it be? Out of scope. Just
    how, and enjoy it.

    Finally, there are plenty of good teachers and textbooks that
    approach science in good ways. In compsci this is pretty common,
    this sort of humility and full context, I think, like Djistra’s “The
    competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own
    skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and
    avoids clever tricks like the plague.” Plenty of other authors
    follow this line, and enthusiasm is definitely common. Also
    Einstein’s stuff is really good and ofter raw like Feynman, and
    others. There are many good authors, I don’t mean to say that
    Feynman is the only one, though he is unique in certain ways.

6.  Oscar Pereira on August 26th, 2008 3:27 am

    Awesome post. Like your many others. I first found your blog when
    the Feynman software engineering post got slashdotted, and I’ve been
    a regular reader since. I have a mixed background of physics and
    engineering, though if I were to choose now, I’d think I’d choose
    physics, because I really miss it. For more than once I wanted to
    buy that set of books from Amazon, but it’s price (together with the
    amount of time I could dedicate to it) was always a deterrent. Like
    you, I also hope that changes in the future.\
     The point you make here about modesty in science is one that should
    be explicitly taught in science courses, but unfortunately continues
    to be something that we hope students get by “osmosis” (Feynman
    himself remarked this several times). Writings like this one might
    help to change that.\
     Anyway, these are my two cents. Congrats for the blog and keep up
    the good writing!

    I happen to be a Feynman fan too, having watched an interview-movie
    called “The pleasure of finding things out”, I switched to a book
    called “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” – written by
    himself
    ([http://www.spirit-tracker.org/details.php?id=3847&hit=1](http://www.spirit-tracker.org/details.php?id=3847&hit=1)).

    He is a great person, if more teachers were like him,
    pupils\\students would be less scared of the stuff they study, and
    more likely to venture into the unknown.

    The reason I am reading that book is not because I am interested in
    physics, but because I like his personality. The book starts with
    several good ideas on how to educate a child, he goes on to talk
    about different ways of handling life situations, etc. There is also
    a chapter in which he writes about the investigation of the shuttle
    accident.

8.  Alan on August 26th, 2008 6:22 am

    Watch the first of these lectures by Feynman, from about 15 minutes
    in, to about 35 minutes in.

    [http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8](http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8)

    Feynman gives a terrific exposition on “understanding”, and how
    nobody, not grad students, not professors, nobody, really
    “understands” quantum mechanics.

9.  milkyway on August 26th, 2008 9:20 am

    Another great author is Kary B. Mullis. He has several things in
    common with Feynman: he is a scientist, he won the Nobel prize, he
    wrote a fun and informative book very much like Feynman’s “Surely
    you’re joking Mr. Feynman” titled “Dancing naked in the mind field”
    and … well I could go on a little bit, indeed, but it’s up to you to
    discover the rest!

    By the way … Great blog, Gustavo!!!

10. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on August 28th,

    @Oscar: I’m not sure if a career in physics is a good option though.
    There are a lot of issues you know… endless postdocs, hard-to-get
    tenure, grueling advisors, abuse, etc. As much as I think the
    science is beautiful, I’m not sure if I’d be happy doing it
    professionally. My personal plan is to live modestly so that I soon
    will have more time to dedicate to learning, and not have to wait
    until retirement
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)
    Thanks for reading, I’m glad /. brought you guys over.

    @Alex: good suggestion. I’ve added the book to the queue as well. By
    the way, cool blog you have, I want to read your article on
    corruption more closely, being from Brazil I’ve spent some time
    thinking about that as well.

    @Alan: great video, I love his accent hahah.

    @milkyway: sweet, more books. This post was well worth it already.
    And thanks for the feedback!

11. Raminder on August 28th, 2008 10:48 pm

    As always a very good post. I can understand your state of mind when
    you say you didn’t understand physics or were afraid that you were
    unable to imagine things as teachers were trying to convey. I’ve
    gone through the same. And I’ve also read some Feynman lectures. I
    remember reading the text in the Feynman book that you’ve put in the
    comment(especially the last section). His words really encourage
    students, because they know they are not alone in it, its not
    difficult for them alone, everybody feels the same difficulty. I
    remember how I fell in love with mathematics. The day I realized
    that matrices were simply an array of numbers arranged in a
    rectangular pattern and stopped asking myself the question ‘But how
    can it be like that?’ I started liking matrices. Suddenly matrices
    were easy. This experience later lead me to like calculus and maths
    in general.

12. [Erez Sh](http://erezsh.wordpress.com) on August 29th, 2008 5:48 am

    It’s great to hear another person disturbed by the simple-mindedness
    of popular culture. Feynman also wrote brilliantly about how
    uncertainty is a part of life and should be embraced (not knowing
    for sure how the world works — it’s OK). This is something your
    teachers, as most people, didn’t learn.

13. [İsmail Arı](http://ismailari.com) on August 30th, 2008 2:24 pm

    I red his book, “Surely, you’re joking Mr. Feynman”, at the beginnig
    of this year and enjoyed it very much that I did not want it to
    finish. It was like an honest friend describing the truth and with
    its encouragement, I did not do physics but I could finish the most
    important parts in my thesis in computer science. I recommend that
    book to know more about Feynman.

    The Nova documentary “The pleasure of finding things out” as Alex
    describes was also great. The book I described was also based on it.

    Besides science, I know that Feynman was very good at drawing and
    bongo playing.

    Thanks for the post, I enjoyed it very much…

14. Keith Brown on August 31st, 2008 1:22 pm

    I feel your pain. I read Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time” a long
    time ago, which is *supposed* to be written for the layman. I was
    doing pretty well until about halfway through. At that point, I was
    lost. I finished it, but the words didn’t really mean anything
    anymore. As a young adult, I also read “Surely, you’re joking Mr.
    Feynman”, and loved it. He was quite a character.

15. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on August 31st,
    2008 11:53 pm

    @İsmail: You’re welcome, I feel much the same way as you do toward
    the books.

    @Keith: yea, I tried reading the Universe in a Nutshell by Hawking
    but hated it. I thought it was the sort of stuff you get in science
    magazines, where they gloss over stuff and do some hand-waving to
    “simplify” it, with the result that it becomes impossible to
    understand.

    When I have some time, I hope to hit up some traditional quantum
    textbooks + ol’ Feynman and learn some of this stuff for real, at
    least get to the point where they were in the 20s and 30s.

16. Rodolfo on September 16th, 2008 7:17 am

    How do I list all your past blog posts by the title? Clicking each
    month on this right side menu, and scrolling all the way down
    through this month’s posts to search an interessant title is not
    cool… I’d like to find a list like the “Recently Written” one that
    showed ALL the posts – not only the recent ones.

    Sorry for using the comments to ask this. I couldn’t figure out
    other way to do it.

    I really enjoyed your posts, by the way! Congratulations!

17. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on September 16th,

    @Rodolfo: thanks a lot for the feedback, and no worries about using
    the comments for this.

    Sadly, there’s currently no way to do what you want in my WordPress
    template. I agree this sucks badly, it’s a must have feature. I hope
    to replace this template within a month or so and fix several
    problems, among which this one is top priority.

    Sorry about that.

    Hi-Great post. I love reading Feynman, even though i dont really
    understand a word of it!

19. Darcy on September 26th, 2008 12:59 pm

    I tried reading Genius by James Gleick after finding an old copy
    laying in my attic.. after reading “Surely You’re Joking” and “What
    Do You Care About What Other People Think?” I found his writing
    style to be too slow for me
    ![:(](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif)
    I’ll keep trying though.\
     I can relate a lot to the author; I am in the same situation.. I’ve
    read Brian Greene, Michio Kaku, and Feynman since my freshman year
    and I find that I just need to put down the science books and learn
    math because I can’t do anything with the concepts any more (I’m a
    junior in high school now) like I could with gravity and E=mc\^2.

20. W0lfness on October 6th, 2008 6:36 pm

    I love Feynman.

    Yeah I know he’s dead, but he talked to his students and to PEOPLE
    like he was human too, he realized towards the end of his life too,
    that everything in life is connected, it’s not all just science or
    art, it’s everything.

    I read all of the collected stories about him, the lectures I want
    to own before I get into them, I’m an Engineering Physics, Computer
    Science, and Math major (who also plans on getting a degree in Art).
    Not yet in school but I know I will be in the future, physics
    fascinates me and has always fascinated me since I was little; but
    the only scientist that has ever earned my respect has been him, not
    Einstein, not Bohr, not even Marie Curie [I'm female] because the
    way he lived life was the way he saw Physics.

    And let me add I don’t consider him a god or something, I simply
    consider him a human, just like everyone else, who gave it his all
    for something that he loved doing. I’m no Feynman, I am not a
    genius, but I am intelligent, and I will do what I can to pass on
    what he started [and what he also continued], hopefully helping the
    world out in the process.

21. F2 on October 8th, 2008 9:58 am

    It is great to see that someone has some enthusisasm left in their
    bones. Yay!

    I am a big Ofey fan myself, although I prefer volume 1.

22. Alan on October 22nd, 2008 3:08 pm

    Thanks for the reference to Feynmann. I viewed his video lectures on
    the internet. Like you, I appreciate his no-nonsense approach to
    teaching physics. Like you, I try to understand it and fail. So I
    shall stick\
     to the macroscopic world. But being an electrical engineer, I will
    continue to dabble in the realm of semiconductor physics and
    chemistry. If you want a no-nonsense approach to epistemology (the
    study of what we know and how we know it), I recommend “Introduction
    to Objectivist Epistemology” by Ayn Rand. It is a good nonfiction
    introduction to epistemology. No math at all. Epistemology is the
    bedrock foundation of all the phyical sciences.

23. Anoop Verma on December 25th, 2008 7:17 am

    Great postings. I’ve decided to re-read the Feynman’s Lectures,
    which are still with me almost after two decades of my final
    connections with formal Physics. I used that book in parts to
    prepare some notes during my graduation and post-graduation in
    Physics. Later I switched to computer programming, specially Data
    Structures & C++.

    Once browsing through the Nobel’s site, I saw Feynman’s name and
    recalled the book, brought it out and started reading it in my free
    time. But now I’m sure to finish it again, this time reading each
    page of it, as if it’s a novel. I’m sure it is better than most of
    the novels that I use to read all the time.

    Thanks Gustavo & all others too, for motivating me….

24. tom on May 16th, 2009 2:45 pm

    Yeah me too. (I keep wanting to go back and understand math and
    physics).\
     The problem is that real science is just the development of ideas
    that describe and predict measurements.\
     If those ideas are mathematical equations then you really have to
    learn the math. If those ideas are built of computer code, then yay
    for us programmers.\
     But I think a lot of good physicists, when they develop a physical
    feel for the ideas they’re working with, already understand the math
    and are working backwards into English just to increase their
    comfort level and/or communicate with other scientists. The rest of
    the public is then fooled into thinking that you can use the English
    to “ease” your way into the math.\
     Any real physicists out there want to back me up on this?
