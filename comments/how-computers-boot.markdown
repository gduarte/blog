    I’m a programmer in high school, have done work with successively
    lower-level programming (mostly Java, C, and then assembly) but this
    is a great article to give a really good sense of the technical
    specifics that happen on startup. Thank you.

    @Pádraig: Thanks for the link, that’s a great reference for GRUB.

    @Brian: Thank you for reading. That’s cool that you’re getting into
    the lower level stuff. Experience with lower-level programming makes
    a big difference in how effectively you design, troubleshoot, and
    think about software. Regardless of what you end up doing, I think
    it’s pretty useful stuff, not to mention it’s a lot of fun.

    Let me know if I can help out in any way with regards to questions
    or book recommendations or whatever. I’ve been working 60+ hours
    these past few weeks, but I try to reply to the comments as often as
    possible.

    Thanks Gustavo,

    I’m not sure I can see the fun in low-level programming, maybe I’m
    not wired that way?

    However your post and the previous one are really excellent for
    internals-phobic like me. Great job!

    Eric.

    yo,\
     cool post. i’m wondering about cache states surrounding reboots. ad
    hoc experimentation seems to show that caches are fickle. this
    probably depends on what kind of disk and system caches one has
    hardware-wise, but i was wondering if, nonetheless, you could shed
    some light on what gets cleared when. wrt caches, are rebooting
    versus reading a file \> max ram comparable?\
     thanks,\

    Your soo right when you say learning assembler is a good basis for
    an IT role/job.

    Many years ago I ventuered into assembler, first on the c64 then the
    amiga. At first i wrote viri and cracked games but then grew up and
    moved onto more worth while causes. This did however give me a
    massive advantage over most candidates at job interviews as you had
    a rough idea of what/how things were accomplished at lower levels
    irrespective of platform or manufacturer.

    If you want a job in IT, spend a few months learning assembler, its
    worth it ten fold over even though you may never do any in your job
    – i now help test and build airport baggage IT systems!

    How does one correct the ‘Checksum error’? I am a novice which is
    why I continue with ‘default settings’. I have WindowsXP (SP2)
    installed on a PC (Pentium III, 500MHz processing power of CPU,
    378MB SD-R memory).

    Other system details of my PC are as follows:

    1.Motherboard OEM — Biostar Microtech Corp.\
     2.Board Model — BIOSTAR Group M6TWG\
     3.BIOS Version — Award Modular BIOS v6.00PG\
     4.Chipset Vendor — Intel Corporation\

    [8.DMI/SMBIOS](http://8.DMI/SMBIOS "Linkification: http://8.DMI/SMBIOS")
    Version — 2.2

    To be honest, I don’t what the above details mean but I can get into
    the BIOS settings but I don’t know the setting values that are the
    correct values for my system.

    Any help would be gratefully accepted.\

    [...] How Computers Boot Up Things start rolling when you press the
    power button on the computer (no! do tell!). Once the motherboard is
    powered up it initializes its own firmware – the chipset and other
    tidbits – and tries to get the CPU running. If things fail at this
    point (e.g., the CPU is busted or missing) then you will likely have
    a system that looks completely dead except for rotating fans. A few
    motherboards manage to emit beeps for an absent or faulty CPU, but
    the zombie-with-fans state is the most common scenario based on my
    experience. Sometimes USB or other devices can cause this to happen:
    unplugging all non-essential devices is a possible cure for a system
    that was working and suddenly appears dead like this. You can then
    single out the culprit device by elimination. [...]

    @Eric: thanks! Regarding the low level stuff, that’s interesting,
    there are definitely people that far prefer algorithms and languages
    to the “machine” bits and bytes stuff. I checked out your blog, I
    really like Skiena’s book too – awesome book. You seem to be an
    algorithms / languages guy
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

    In school I did Math for my major, so I really enjoy the conceptual,
    hardware-free parts of the playground too. But I’m sort of in the
    middle – I love kernels and OSes as well. So I dunno, jack of all
    trades master of none for me I guess. thanks for stopping by.

    @dino: that’s a good question. Which caches are you thinking about?
    You should check out the Intel manuals (there are links to them in
    the previous) post, they explain some of the CPU caching behavior
    wrt to booting.

    But these are just the processor caches. There are of course the
    kernel caches (the page cache), hard drive controller caches (which
    might be 8 MB or 16MB of stuff, depending on the hardware).

    Reading a very large file for example might jack up the kernel’s
    page cache and the hard drive cache, but might leave a lot of caches
    intact like TLBs and processor L1/L2 cache potentially – after all
    you’re going through a lot of data but the code is in a tight loop.

    @j: For the stuff covered here, they’d be identical as far as I
    know. Internally there major differences in the CPU arch between
    Intel and AMD, but to an “external observer” they behave very much
    alike.

    @Stuza: I notice big differences too in people who have a decent
    idea of the overall system and those who don’t. Especially when it
    comes to troubleshooting, perf work, and fixing complex bugs – there
    are things that people take days to do that somebody comfortable
    with lower level stuff might solve in minutes. I did some cracking
    too back in day, man I loved that stuff, it was like solving
    puzzles.
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

    @neso: thanks. I too have some fond memories of DOS times.

    @Richard: thanks for the kind words – I’m glad you liked the posts.
    It’s great to hear from folks who enjoyed them.

    @Manu: that sounds like a CMOS checksum error right? There is a
    battery that keeps the CMOS configurations while your computer is
    powered off. Usually checksum errors happen when this battery loses
    its juice, and the computer starts to lose CMOS configurations when
    you turn it off. Then when it wakes up the configs are gone, and
    that’s when you get this error. Changing the battery is the most
    common solution afaik, and it’s a cheap thing to do.

    I don’t actually work with PC repair stuff though, so this is my
    guess based on my own past experience.

    @mschaef, @John: thanks!

    @dclayton: that’s right. In MS-DOS days the BIOS was used by
    applications and MS-DOS itself. Nowadays once the kernel takes over,
    the BIOS is out.

    @andrewl: thanks for catching it. HAH. So much for my math degree –
    not to mention doing an off-by-one in an internals post that got
    reddited. hehe. Anyhow, I’ll fix it, good catch.

26. [TiTi](http://codding) on June 12th, 2008 3:19 pm

    “The BIOS now reads the first 512-byte sector (sector zero) of the
    hard disk.” -\> Which one if you have severals ?

    In fact WHERE is the MBR, physically speaking :\
     -In the first drive on the primary connector ?\
     -On the disk or inside a memory chip ?

27. Faisal Iqbal on June 14th, 2008 2:57 pm

    A very nice article indeed You seem to be the internals guy. Btw can
    you suggest a bit more detailed reading on it, specifically with
    regard to Real Mode and the Reset Vector thing. I can’t seem to
    understand everything about them like why the intel processors jump
    to reset vector at all, or what if you don’t have 4 GB memory [yeah
    may sounds noob :p]

28. [Keith Brown](http://radarjockey.net) on June 14th, 2008 8:19 pm

    Wow, I love your articles. “Stumbled upon” this one and read a bunch
    more on your site. Keep ‘em coming! Our interests are very much
    aligned, although apparently you manage to make a living at
    software, while for me it’s only a hobby. Yes, I’m a language
    dabbler… I used to run my own server too, but I don’t have the
    bandwidth you do. Heavy sigh. I’m also a licensed pilot and air
    traffic controller, so your comparison of aviation safety to
    software security was fascinating.

29. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on June 16th, 2008
    4:38 am

    I apologize for the delayed replies, I’m delivering a project
    tomorrow and hence have been working intensely.

    @TiTi: the MBR \_is\_ on the disk, absolutely. It’s written on disk
    platters like any other data, it’s completely part of the disk. As
    to which disk you boot, you get to configure that in the BIOS. It’s
    usually configured on a disk-bus basis, such as “Boot the IDE Master
    on IDE channel 0″ or “Boot the disk in SATA 1″.

    @Faisal: I’m very ignorant, I just like this stuff for a hobby. You
    should think of the reset vector thing as a protocol. Intel sells
    all these CPUs, and they need to behave in a certain way for people
    to stick them in various devices. So Intel says, “OK, listen, when
    the CPU fires up, it’ll try to read memory at place XYZ and execute
    whatever it finds there.” Then the hardware guys can say: “Ah ok.
    Then whenever I build something – motherboard, satellite, whatever –
    that uses Intel, I know that what I need to do to keep the CPU happy
    is feed it XYZ”.

    You should read my post on the chipset though at
    [http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/motherboard-chipsets-memory-map](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/motherboard-chipsets-memory-map)\
     That should clarify why you don’t actually need 4 gigs of RAM.

    @Keith: that’s cool, thanks for the kind words

    I am hoping to get my pilot license at some point as well, maybe
    next year as right now I don’t have \_any\_ time for it. And I hope
    to have a better writing schedule once I’m done with my current
    death-march project at work.

37. Tom Amoth on June 24th, 2008 10:22 am

    I am making a comment on the following statement:\
     2. Due to its tiny size, the code in the MBR does just enough to
    load another sector from disk that\
     contains additional boostrap code. This sector might be the boot
    sector for a partition, but\
     could also be a sector that was hard-coded into the MBR code when
    the MBR was installed.

    This statement at least puts on the appearance of implying the
    single-sector\
     MBR is too tiny to do more than read a single record from another
    part of the HD–which is quite inaccurate. Boot code uses interrupt
    13(hex) to read the HD; this command can read up to 127 sectors at a
    time just as easily as one sector. This interrupt is among many
    described in the book,\
     ‘The Undocumented PC’ which gives comprehensive information on how
    to use such features–unlike, say, Peter Norton’s ‘Inside the IBM PC’
    which merely lists the kinds of things int13 can do but doesn’t tell
    what to load in what registers. A 512-byte sector is ample space to
    include the partition table, code to search said table, and error
    messages.\
     One thing the DOS/Windows MBR code does immediately is to move
    itself\
     to location 0x3C00 so a boot from a partition can be loaded into
    7C00.

    **How Computers Boot Up…**

    Explains x86 boot sequence…

39. JSchmidt on June 25th, 2008 12:15 pm

    Ref: JohnPaul \#35

    Umm… I only know Windows – but I doubt IP is from boot in linux

    A computer determines it’s IP address well after boot. It is
    determined in user-code, through one of the Services. Depending on
    whether you have a live connection (Cable, DSL) or not, your IP is
    determined right away, or later when you attempt to connect
    (dialup).

    There are two main types of IP address ‘getting’.\
     Static IPs are … static … meaning that they don’t change and they
    don’t have to be searched for. These are assigned manually by “your
    network administrator” (yeah right.) However, dynamic IPs are
    determined from your ISP or router (whichever comes first). This is
    through the DHCP service, so if you use static IPs, you shouldn’t
    need this service. However, if your computer locks on Assigning IP
    Address… then check to see if this service is disabled.

    Windows accesses the internet through a Default Gateway which is the
    IP address of your router inside your network (something like
    192.168.0.1), or the IP address of your ISP (dialup). Names such as
    “google.com” are resolved into IP addresses through DNS servers,
    which are either provided by your ISP and manually entered, or
    automatically. Check services DNS Client and/or DHCP for these type
    of errors.

    JSchmidt\#39.\
     Thank you for the information. It makes sense that for dynamic
    assignment, it is a (Windows) service during the boot process that
    initiates the process of obtaining the IP address.

    “If things fail at this point (e.g., the CPU is busted or missing)
    then you will likely have a system that looks completely dead except
    for rotating fans. A few motherboards manage to emit beeps for an
    absent or faulty CPU, but the zombie-with-fans state is the most
    common scenario based on my experience.”\
     In my experience out here in the south of India is the same if the
    connector edge of the RAM modules are coated (dirty). Shining (with
    a pencil eraser) the connector edge of the RAM (if it has not
    failed) can get the machine to boot up from a state as above. It
    should be ensured that removing, cleaning and reinserting the RAM
    module be done with the power cable to the PC removed. If you are in
    a low discharge environment then ensure that you have or grounded
    yourself. Avoid holding/touching the RAM module connector edges.

    @Khan: that’s right, this matches my experience as well. Missing RAM
    == zombie state. I’ll edit to include this, thanks for pointing it
    out.

    How (Intel Bios Based) Computers Boot Up

56. [Alex Ionescu](http://www.alex-ionescu.com) on July 16th, 2008 11:59
    pm

    It’s worth nothing that Vista’s boot process is different, since
    NTLDR is gone. You’ve also not touched on ntdetect.com which is used
    on 32-bit Windows to query the BIOS for non-PnP devices. Finally,
    note that in Windows, the switch to protected mode is done as one of
    the first steps in NTLDR, so there’s almost no code that runs in
    Real Mode, except ntdetect.com which is called through a special
    identity-mapped jump.

    Also, EFI radically changes all this (ie: on Windows 64-bit and
    Intel Macs).

57. Kilian Hekhuis on July 17th, 2008 1:43 am

    Unreal mode is not “a technique where a program switches back and
    forth between real mode and protected mode”, as is aptly described
    in the linked Wikipedia article. It’s a technique that allows
    accessing memory above one megabyte when on realmode. It is set up
    by switching to protected mode and back, once. Not ‘back and forth’.
    One could go back and forth between rm and pm to fill memory above
    1MB though (loading below 1MB, switch to pm, copy to above 1MB,
    etc.).

58. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on July 17th, 2008
    1:57 am

    @Alex: wow, thanks for stopping by. I’m planning on doing a post
    centered around the Windows boot and go into more detail. Maybe I’ll
    send you a draft to review if you’ve got time. The EFI stuff had to
    stay out due to space. It’s a tough format, blog posts.

    @Kilian: right, this memory fill is exactly what is happening here.
    I’ll fix the language so it’s not misleading.

    Hey there Gustavo and the rest. I have this irritating problem: my
    PC just won’t boot. Specs: 1.6Ghz, 20 Gb 128 Mb. Mercury motherboard
    PVCL3266M-L V3OA.\
     The message I get is: No boot device. When I get to the CMOS
    settings there are not detected drives (including the CD ROM). I
    read somewhere that I needed Raid and SATA controller drivers but I
    just don’t know where to download them and how to install them in
    this ‘dead’ machine of mine. Another thing, How can one create a
    rescue disk from the using a windows 2000 operating system? Even in
    XP? Am a newbie so please don’t bruise my brain with jargon.

66. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on August 28th,
    2008 1:11 am

    @Andy: By the time you’re in the BIOS, there are no 3rd party
    drivers loaded or anything like that. All of the code running in the
    BIOS is hard-coded is stored in your motherboard, and it should be
    able to detect all the devices in the computer.

    Did this happen all of a sudden? You might want to check the cables
    that connect the devices to the motherboard (gray IDE cables). Did
    anything change on the computer?

    Sorry, it’s hard to troubleshoot remotely and I’m very pressed for
    time lately.

    Hi Gustavo Duarte,\
     Why not BIOS have functionality of MBR(stage1 and stage2 or
    bootloader)?\
     I am thinking OS writer should not have to worry about MBR
    code…BIOS will handle these task of bootloader.

    I know i am wrong…..plz tell me Why i am wrong?

75. noobie on December 7th, 2008 4:12 am

    Hi Gustavo,

    Excellent site!! Superb explanation of the chipsets and the boot
    process (I have read only these two so far, I’m sure i’ll enjoy the
    others too..).

    One question though… you mention: “the partition table is
    standardized: it is a 64-byte area with four 16-byte entries
    describing how the disk has been divided up ”\
     Does this mean a maximum of 4 partitions can exist on a disk. This
    would mean a max of 4 OSes can be installed on a disk? Is this
    correct?

76. [Gustavo Duarte](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog) on December 7th,
    2008 1:52 pm

    @noobie: good catch
    ![;)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)
    You’re right that if only ‘standard’ partitions were used, the disk
    would indeed be limited to 4 partitions and, realistically, 4 OSes.

    However, people came up with the idea of an [extended
    partition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_partition). You can
    mark one of the 4 partitions in the MBR as an extended partition,
    which tells the OS that it should look for ANOTHER partition table
    to describe the extended partition. These can be daisy chained so
    that you can create an infinite number of partitions, subject only
    to drive space.

    but I cannot do it so easily under the Windows OS. Why can I not

    I have only one question, which i can’t understand from long time:\
     Why BIOS functions can’t be accessible from Protected Mode?\
     It means – i know Real Mode has completely different addressing
    (and much more, and beside BIOS functions wouldn’t be usefull for
    modern OSes) – but why BIOS manufactures didn’t do something
    additional like “BIOS functions for Protected Mode”?\
     Is there something about Protected Mode, that makes BIOS completely
    unpossible?\

    I have 2 questions:

    ​(1) The first instruction to be executed by a CPU after the reset
    is 0Xfffffff0. That is 16 bytes short of 4G. What happens when the
    physically installed RAM is say just 1 G?

    ​(2) Who puts that jump instruction at the address 0Xffffff0?

    Thanks,

101. Natarajan on February 10th, 2010 3:18 am

    Hi Abdul,

    Here is the ans for ur query

    ​1. Basically the address which [F000:FFFF0] CPU looks to execute
    after reset is a Memory Mapped Address – Its not a physical address.
    So How much physical memory you installed on system doesn’t affect
    reset vector address.\
     In fact during this time memory is not yet initialized so system
    does even know whether you have 1GB RAM or 4GB RAM.

    2.Chipset vendor needs to provide this detail.

    This is not how \*all\* computers boot.

    Some use EFI (no BIOS), also ARM based machines have none, neither
    do pre-Intel Macs.

122. [CapeJag](http://in-view.net) on March 11th, 2011 9:35 am

    So… do any of you know the actual origin of ‘bootstrap’? For real:
    “A convenient loop on the back of a boot, allowing one to ‘easily’
    pull on ones own boot.”

    The original bootstrap loaders for most mainframe computers before
    ROM was invented was a single binary punched card containing an 80
    byte/word program max that was hardwired to be read into low memory
    and then a branch to location ’1′ was issued to execute this
    bootstrap routine which then loaded the remaining binary cards into
    subsequent regions of memory.

    IBM 1401 [early 1960's] only required a single bootstrap card.
    Honeywell 6000 Series [mid 1970's] needed one card to start, THREE
    more to provide sufficient logic to load the rest of the bootloader
    and about 350 more punched cards to provide a basic OS to get the
    real one loaded off disk! Seemed to take forever when a reboot was
    in order – actually, about 5 minutes… And now we complain if it
    takes more than a few seconds.

    We have it easy now, just turn it on,

123. peter on March 11th, 2011 1:29 pm

    The actual origin of bootstrap CapeJag, you’re only half way there.
    . .\
     It’s (supposedly, at any rate) from the expression “pulling
    yourself up by your own bootstraps” ie the paradoxical notion of
    pulling on the straps you describe in order to lift oneself up –
    thus the act of getting the computer to do something without already
    having a running program being seen as analagous to this.

124. philip on March 11th, 2011 2:40 pm

    CapeJag, bah, feeding a 1401 or a 360 with punch cards was for wimps

    Real men, women too, could punch the bootstrap commands into the
    buttons on the consoles of Honeywell 200′s and Digital PDP 6s & 8′s,

129. Lukas Korsika on March 16th, 2011 9:36 pm

    Firstly, excellent post. A great read, and a good refresher on these
    things. There is, however, one part that is either confusingly
    worded or factually wrong. As this is an insightful and accessible
    article, I’d hate to see it mislead people; I feel obligated to
    point out this minor error.\
     As stated in Kilian’s post on unreal mode, your description is not
    entirely correct, and you do not seem to have fixed this since his
    comment. As I understand it (and I haven’t played with processors on
    such a low level for a few years), one of two things is happening:\
     – EITHER, the bootloader switches back and forth between real and
    protected mode, loading \~1MB of data from the disk in real mode,
    then copying it to higher memory in protected mode. However, I must
    stress that this is not unreal mode.\
     – OR, the bootloader puts the CPU into unreal mode, by switching to
    protected mode, loading a GDT with segment descriptors that have
    limits \> 1MB[1], then switching back into real mode. On processors
    \> 286 (which switches back into real mode by … resetting), this
    results in a real mode with segment size limits removed, so you can
    access all 32-bits of address space[2], while still calling the BIOS
    functions (and generally operating in real mode). This requires
    \*one\* switch into protected mode and back, and the bootloader can
    then remain in unreal mode until it hands off control to the kernel.

    In short (and this is the main point of my post) “unreal mode” is
    not switching back and forth between real and protected mode. It is
    real mode with the address space limitations removed, allowing you
    to directly access any and all memory (well, up to the 4G available
    in protected mode. Long mode is a different kettle of fish). For an
    example of how to do this, see OSdev.org[3]

    I seem to have written a little more than I originally intended, but
    I suppose it’s better to make myself clear than be misunderstood
    (and I hope I have done the former). Let me repeat that I think your
    blog is excellent, and very interesting. I’ve learned a lot about
    areas where I have less experience in. I hope I have not come across
    too brusquely, for it was certainly not my intention. Looking
    forward to seeing more insightful posts whenever you can find the
    time.
    ![:)](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)\
     ===\
     [1] Technically you need to load the GDT before switching to
    protected mode, but … implementation details.\
     [2] Technically, access to full memory also requires messing with
    the A20 gate, or you only get even 1-MB blocks. But again,
    implementation details.\

    One way to quickly test the motherboard and cpu is to remove the
    memory (turn it on) and if the computer beeps at you, at least you
    know it gone all the way to the POST and indicting motherboard and
    cpu are ok.

    Does this quick test have merit???

136. Arbiel on September 21st, 2011 2:31 am

    Hi Gustavo

    Thank you for your post. It makes arise a question that I did not
    find the answer yet. You write

    “After the POST the BIOS wants to boot up an operating system, which
    must be found somewhere: hard drives, CD-ROM drives, floppy disks,
    etc. The actual order in which the BIOS seeks a boot device is user
    configurable. If there is no suitable boot device the BIOS halts
    with a complaint like “Non-System Disk or Disk Error.” A dead hard
    drive might present with this symptom. Hopefully this doesn’t happen
    and the BIOS finds a working disk allowing the boot to proceed.”

    How does the BIOS recognize a device to be suitable for booting ? I
    mean when you have several disks connected, all can be a priori
    suitable for booting as,all have a MBR.

    Let’s suppose the user has configured the external devices to be
    looked for before the other ones, but none contains regular
    bootstrapping code. As there are numerous such codes (Windows, LILO,
    Grub, and others to come) the BIOS certainly neads particular pieces
    of data to decide that these devices are unsuitable for booting, and
    to continue its search for the booting device until it reaches to
    internal disk.

    Which are these particular pieces of data ?

    And a second question : is the boot flag only used by Windows’
    bootstrapping code ?

    Thank again for your post\*

    power button on the computer (no! do tell!). Once the motherboard is
    powered up it initializes its own firmware – the chipset and other
    tidbits – and tries to get the CPU running. If things fail at this
    point (e.g., the CPU is busted or missing) then you will likely have
    a system that looks completely dead except for rotating fans. A few
    motherboards manage to emit beeps for an absent or faulty CPU, but
    the zombie-with-fans state is the most common scenario based on my
    experience. Sometimes USB or other devices can cause this to happen:
    unplugging all non-essential devices is a possible cure for a system
    that was working and suddenly appears dead like this. You can then
    single out the culprit device by elimination. Filed under: random —

    I find it funny as the boot process hasn’t changed for decades now
    (since the DOS era). I’m sure that there’s a lot of optimization to
    be done – but it seems there are just too many interdependenc and
    manufacturers of software and hardware are hesitant to make that
    change.

    I don’t think it’s logical to wait 30 seconds for our computers to
    boot – while it takes a much slower tab literally a couple of
    seconds.
