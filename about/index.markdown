This is a site for people interested in tech and science posts that are
accessible yet rigorous. I cover both newly published papers and long-standing
topics in computer science, machine learning, genomics, and social sciences.
I try to make things as simple as possible, but not simpler, staying true to the
papers, source code, and data.

Best way to subscribe is via the [newsletter](/subscribe). There's an [RSS] feed
as well, and [Twitter].  If you're in Colorado and would like to get together
for coffee, snowboarding, or going outside, hit me up.
