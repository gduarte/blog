This blog aims to teach and amuse people interested in computers. I distill
practical computer science into clear prose illustrated by diagrams to bring you
the essence of each topic.  No filler, no obtuse language, no sloppy
presentation.  These posts are here to serve *you*, respecting your time,
patience, and intelligence. Treats for the geek mind.

I love to write and to know that I've helped others learn. If there is something
you'd like to see covered, let me know. At the moment I'm gathering material for
a book on computer internals, so there's some focus on that, but I like to mix
things up.  I also write about software development, programming tools, and the
industry.

Thank you for reading! I invite you to subscribe via [RSS] and

or snowboarding. I'm often in Brazil as well, usually BH or Rio, and happy to
meet fellow .br nerds.
