This is a site for curious people interested in learning about technology and
science, but who want **rigorous** material that stays true to source code,
papers, and data. No hand-waving or mushy analogies - we give you the real deal.

We cover mostly computer science and machine learning topics, with a dash of
other fields thrown in. Each post is made as simple as possible, but not
simpler, and we use illustrations to help convey difficult concepts.  Everything
from newly published papers to established knowledge is fair game. The goal is
one post a week.

Please subscribe via the [newsletter](/subscribe). There's an [RSS feed] as
well, and [Twitter].  Also, if you're in Colorado and would like to get together
for coffee, snowboarding, or going outside, hit me up.
