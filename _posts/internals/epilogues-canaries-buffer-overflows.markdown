Last week we looked at [how the stack works][stack] and how stack frames are
built during function _prologues_. Now it's time to look at the inverse process
as stack frames are destroyed in function _epilogues_.  Let's bring back our
friend `add.c`:

{% codeblock lang:c Simple Add Program - add.c %}
int add(int a, int b)
{
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
}

int main(int argc)
{
    int answer;
    answer = add(40, 2);
}
{% endcodeblock %}

We're executing line 4, right after the assignment of `a + b` into `result`. This is
what happens:

<img id="returnFromAdd" class="center" src="/img/stack/returnFromAdd.png"
usemap="#mapreturnFromAdd">
<map id="mapreturnFromAdd" name="mapreturnFromAdd">

</map>


The first instruction is redundant and a little silly because we know `eax` is
already equal to `result`, but this is what you get with optimization turned
off. The `leave` instruction then runs, doing two tasks for the price of one: it
resets `esp` to point to the start of the current stack frame, and then restores
the saved ebp value. These two operations are logically distinct and thus are
broken up in the diagram, but they happen atomically if you're tracing with
a debugger.

After `leave` runs the previous stack frame is restored. The only vestige of the
call to `add` is the return address on top of the stack. It contains the address
of the instruction in `main` that must run after `add` is done. The `ret`
instruction takes care of it: it pops the return address into the `eip`
register, which points to the next instruction to be executed.  The program has
now returned to main, which resumes:

<img id="returnFromMain" class="center" src="/img/stack/returnFromMain.png"
usemap="#mapreturnFromMain">
<map id="mapreturnFromMain" name="mapreturnFromMain">
<area shape='poly' coords='754,6,754,312,6,312,6,6' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/add-gdb-output.txt#L175'>
<area shape='poly' coords='754,312,754,618,6,618,6,312' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/add-gdb-output.txt#L181'>
<area shape='poly' coords='754,618,754,924,6,924,6,618' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/add-gdb-output.txt#L181'>

</map>

`main` copies the return value from `add` into local variable `answer` and then
runs its own epilogue, which is identical to any other. Again the only
peculiarity in `main` is that the saved ebp is null, since it is the first stack
frame in our code. In the last step, execution has been returned to the
C runtime (`libc`), which will exit to the operating system. Here's a diagram
with the [full return sequence](/img/stack/returnSequence.png) for those
who need it.

You now have an excellent grasp of how the stack operates, so let's have some
fun and look at one of the most infamous hacks of all time: exploiting the stack
buffer overflow. Here is a vulnerable program:

{% codeblock lang:c Vulnerable Program - buffer.c %}
void doRead()
{
        char buffer[28];
        gets(buffer);
}

int main(int argc)
{
        doRead();
}
{% endcodeblock %}

The code above uses [gets](http://linux.die.net/man/3/gets) to read from
standard input. `gets` keeps reading until it encounters a newline or end of
file. Here's what the stack looks like after a string has been read:

{% img /img/stack/bufferCopy.png %}

The problem here is that `gets` is unaware of `buffer`'s size: it will blithely
keep reading input and stuffing data into the stack beyond `buffer`,
obliterating the saved ebp value, return address, and whatever else is below.
To exploit this behavior, attackers craft a precise payload and feed it into the
program. This is what the stack looks like during an attack, after the call to
`gets`:

{% img /img/stack/bufferOverflowExploit.png %}

The basic idea is to provide malicious assembly code to be executed _and_
overwrite the return address on the stack to point to that code. It is a bit
like a virus invading a cell, subverting it, and introducing some RNA to further
its goals.

And like a virus, the exploit's payload has many notable features.  It starts
with several `nop` instructions to increase the odds of successful exploitation.
This is because the return address is absolute and must be guessed, since
attackers don't know exactly where in the stack their code will be stored. But
as long as they land on a `nop`, the exploit works: the processor will execute
the nops until it hits the instructions that do work.

The `exec /bin/sh` symbolizes raw assembly instructions that execute a shell
(imagine for example that the vulnerability is in a networked program, so the
exploit might provide shell access to the system). The idea of feeding raw
assembly to a program expecting a command or user input is shocking at first,
but that's part of what makes security research so fun and mind-expanding.  To
give you an idea of how weird things get, sometimes the vulnerable program calls
`tolower` or `toupper` on its inputs, forcing attackers to write assembly
instructions whose bytes do not fall into the range of upper- or lower-case
ascii letters.

Finally, attackers repeat the guessed return address several times, again to
tip the odds ever in their favor. By starting on a 4-byte boundary and providing
multiple repeats, they are more likely to overwrite the original return address
on the stack.

Thankfully, modern operating systems have a host of
[protections against buffer overflows](http://paulmakowski.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/smashing-the-stack-in-2011/), including non-executable stacks and _stack canaries_. The "canary" name comes from the [canary in a coal mine](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine) expression, an addition to computer science's rich vocabulary. In the words of Steve McConnell:

{% blockquote Steve McConnell, Code Complete 2 %}
Computer science has some of the most colorful language of any field. In what other field can you walk into a sterile room, carefully controlled at 68Â°F, and find viruses, Trojan horses, worms, bugs, bombs, crashes, flames, twisted sex changers, and fatal errors?
{% endblockquote %}

At any rate, here's what a stack canary looks like:

{% img /img/stack/bufferCanary.png %}

Canaries are implemented by the compiler. For example, GCC's
[stack-protector](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.3/gcc/Optimize-Options.html)
option causes canaries to be used in any function that is potentially
vulnerable. The function prologue loads a magic value into the canary location,
and the epilogue makes sure the value is intact. If it's not, a buffer overflow
(or bug) likely happened and the program is aborted via
[__stack_chk_fail](http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/libc---stack-chk-fail-1.html).
Due to their strategic location on the stack, canaries make the exploitation of
stack buffer overflows much harder.

This finishes our journey within the depths of the stack. We don't want to delve
too greedily and too deep. Next week we'll go up a notch in abstraction to take
a good look at recursion, tail calls and other tidbits, probably using Google's
V8. To end this epilogue and prologue talk, I'll close with a cherished quote
inscribed on a monument in the American National Archives:
