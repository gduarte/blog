The last post in this series looks at closures, objects, and other creatures
roaming beyond the stack. Much of what we'll see is language neutral, but I'll
focus on JavaScript with a dash of C.  Let's start with a simple C program that
reads a song and a band name and outputs them back to the user:

{% include_code x86-stack/stackFolly.c %}

If you run this gem, here's what you get (=> denotes program output):

{% codeblock lang:console %}
./stackFolly
=> Enter song, then band:
The Past is a Grotesque Animal
of Montreal

=> ?ǿontreal
=> by ?ǿontreal
{% endcodeblock %}

Ayeee! Where did things go so wrong? (Said every C beginner, ever.)

It turns out that the contents of a function's stack variables are **only valid
while the stack frame is active**, that is, until the function returns.  Upon
return, the memory used by the stack frame is [deemed free][epilogues] and
liable to be overwritten in the next function call.

Below is *exactly* what happens in this case. The diagrams now have image maps,
so you can click on a piece of data to see the relevant gdb output (gdb commands
are [here][stackFolly-gdb-commands]). As soon as `read()` is done with the song
name, the stack is thus:

<img id="readSong" class="center" src="/img/stack/readSong.png"
usemap="#mapreadSong">
<map id="mapreadSong" name="mapreadSong">
<area shape='poly' coords='754,6,754,86,14,86,14,6' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/stackFolly-gdb-output.txt#L47'>
<area shape='poly' coords='754,146,754,226,114,226,114,146' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/stackFolly-gdb-output.txt#L70'>
</map>

At this point, the `song` variable actually points to the song name. Sadly, the
memory storing that string is *ready to be reused* by the stack frame of
whatever function is called next. In this case, `read()` is called again, with
the same stack frame layout, so the result is this:

<img id="readBand" class="center" src="/img/stack/readBand.png"
usemap="#mapreadBand">
<map id="mapreadBand" name="mapreadBand">
<area shape='poly' coords='754,6,754,86,14,86,14,6' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/stackFolly-gdb-output.txt#L76'>
<area shape='poly' coords='754,146,754,226,114,226,114,146' href='https://github.com/gduarte/blog/blob/master/code/x86-stack/stackFolly-gdb-output.txt#L79'>
</map>

The band name is read into the same memory location and overwrites the
previously stored song name. `band` and `song` end up pointing to the exact
same spot. Finally, we didn't even get "of Montreal" output correctly. Can you
guess why?

And so it happens that the stack, for all its usefulness, has this serious
limitation. It cannot be used by a function to store data that needs to outlive
the function's execution. You must resort to the [heap][readIntoHeap] and say
goodbye to the hot caches, deterministic instantaneous operations, and easily
computed offsets. On the plus side, it [works][readIntoHeap-gdb-output]:

<img id="readIntoHeap" class="center" src="/img/stack/readIntoHeap.png">

The price is you must now remember to `free()` memory or take a performance hit
on a garbage collector, which finds unused heap objects and frees them. That's
the fundamental tradeoff between stack and heap: performance vs. flexibility.

Most languages' virtual machines take a middle road that mirrors what
C programmers do. The stack is used for **value types**, things like integers,
floats and booleans. These are stored *directly* in local variables and object
fields as a sequence of bytes specifying a *value* (like `argc` above).  In
contrast, heap inhabitants are **reference types** such as strings and
[objects][v8-objects].  Variables and fields contain a memory address that
*references* these objects, like `song` and `band` above.

Consider this JavaScript function:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function fn()
{
    var a = 10;
    var b = { name: 'foo', n: 10 };
}
{% endcodeblock %}

This might produce the following:

<img id="fnFrame" class="center" src="/img/stack/fnFrame.png"
usemap="#mapFnFrame">
<map id="mapFnFrame" name="mapFnFrame">
<area shape='poly' coords='524,36,524,116,424,116,424,36' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#1671'>
<area shape='poly' coords='722,36,722,116,622,116,622,36' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#8656'>
<area shape='poly' coords='514,176,514,256,434,256,434,176' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#1264'>
</map>

I say "might" because specific behaviors depend heavily on implementation. This
post takes a V8-centric approach with many diagram shapes linking to relevant
source code. In V8, only [small integers][v8-smi] are
[stored as values][v8-storage].  Also,
from now on I'll show strings directly in objects to reduce visual noise, but
keep in mind they exist separately in the heap, as shown above.

Now let's take a look at closures, which are simple but get weirdly hyped up and
mythologized. Take a trivial JS function:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function add(a, b)
{
        var c = a + b;
        return c;
}
{% endcodeblock %}

This function defines a **lexical scope**, a happy little kingdom where the
names `a`, `b`, and `c` have precise meanings. They are the two parameters and
one local variable declared by the function. The program might use those same
names elsewhere, but within `add` *that's what they refer to*.  And while
lexical scope is a fancy term, it aligns well with our intuitive understanding:
after all, we can quite literally **see** the bloody thing, much as a lexer
does, as a textual block in the program's source.

Having seen stack frames in action, it's easy to imagine an implementation for
this name specificity.  Within `add`, these names refer to stack locations
private to *each running instance* of the function. That's in fact how it
often plays out in a VM.

So let's nest two lexical scopes:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function makeGreeter()
{
    return function hi(name) {
        console.log('hi, ' + name);
    }
}

var hi = makeGreeter();
hi('dear reader'); // prints "hi, dear reader"
{% endcodeblock %}

That's more interesting. Function `hi` is built at runtime within `makeGreeter`.
It has its own lexical scope, where `name` is an argument on the stack, but
*visually* it sure looks like it can access its parent's lexical scope as well,
which it can. Let's take advantage of that:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function makeGreeter(greeting)
{
    return function greet(name) {
        console.log(greeting + ', ' + name);
    }
}

var heya = makeGreeter('HEYA');
heya('dear reader'); // prints "HEYA, dear reader"
{% endcodeblock %}

A little strange, but pretty cool. There's something about it though that
violates our intuition: `greeting` sure looks like a stack variable, the kind
that should be dead after `makeGreeter()` returns. And yet, since `greet()`
keeps working, *something funny* is going on. Enter the closure:

<img id="closure" class="center" src="/img/stack/closure.png"
usemap="#mapClosure">
<map id="mapClosure" name="mapClosure">
<area shape='poly' coords='260,36,260,126,80,126,80,36' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/contexts.h#188'>
<area shape='poly' coords='681,36,681,126,321,126,321,36' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#7245'>
</map>

The VM allocated an object to store the parent variable used by the inner
`greet()`. It's as if `makeGreeter`'s lexical scope had been **closed over** at
that moment, crystallized into a heap object for as long as needed (in this case,
the lifetime of the returned function).  Hence the name **closure**, which makes
a lot of sense when you see it that way. If more parent variables had been used
(or *captured*), the `Context` object would have more properties, one per
captured variable. Naturally, the code emitted for `greet()` knows to read
`greeting` from the Context object, rather than expect it on the stack.

Here's a fuller example:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function makeGreeter(greetings)
{
    var count = 0;
    var greeter = {};

    for (var i = 0; i < greetings.length; i++) {
        var greeting = greetings[i];

        greeter[greeting] = function(name) {
            count++;
            console.log(greeting + ', ' + name);
        }
    }

    greeter.count = function() { return count; }

    return greeter;
}

var greeter = makeGreeter(["hi", "hello", "howdy"])
greeter.hi('poppet'); // prints "howdy, poppet"
greeter.hello('darling'); // prints "howdy, darling"
greeter.count(); // returns 2
{% endcodeblock %}

Well... `count()` works, but our greeter is stuck in *howdy*.  Can you tell why?
What we're doing with `count` is a clue: even though the lexical scope is closed
over into a heap object, the *values* taken by the variables (or object
properties) can still be changed. Here's what we have:

<img id="greeterFail" class="center" src="/img/stack/greeterFail.png" usemap="#mapGreeterFail">
<map id="mapGreeterFail" name="mapGreeterFail">
<area shape='poly' coords='118,186,118,326,18,326,18,186' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#1671'>
<area shape='poly' coords='510,36,510,146,170,146,170,36' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#7245'>
<area shape='poly' coords='510,156,510,266,170,266,170,156' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#7245'>
<area shape='poly' coords='510,276,510,386,170,386,170,276' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#7245'>
<area shape='poly' coords='510,396,510,466,170,466,170,396' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/objects.h#7245'>
<area shape='poly' coords='742,206,742,306,562,306,562,206' href='https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/contexts.h#188'>
</map>

There is one common context shared by all functions. That's why `count` works.
But the greeting is also being shared, and it was set to the last value iterated
over, "howdy" in this case. That's a pretty common error, and the easiest way to
avoid it is to introduce a function call to take the closed-over variable as an
argument. In CoffeeScript, the [do][coffee-do] command provides an easy way to
do so.  Here's a simple solution for our greeter:

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
function makeGreeter(greetings)
{
    var count = 0;
    var greeter = {};

    greetings.forEach(function(greeting) {
        greeter[greeting] = function(name) {
            count++;
            console.log(greeting + ', ' + name);
        }
    });

    greeter.count = function() { return count; }

    return greeter;
}

var greeter = makeGreeter(["hi", "hello", "howdy"])
greeter.hi('poppet'); // prints "hi, poppet"
greeter.hello('darling'); // prints "hello, darling"
greeter.count(); // returns 2
{% endcodeblock %}

It now works, and the result becomes:

<img id="greeter" class="center" src="/img/stack/greeter.png"
usemap="#mapGreeter">
<map id="mapGreeter" name="mapGreeter">

</map>

That's a lot of arrows! But here's the interesting feature: in our code, we
closed over two nested lexical contexts, and sure enough we get two linked
Context objects in the heap. You could nest and close over many lexical
contexts, Russian-doll style, and you end up with essentially a linked list of
all these Context objects.

Of course, just as you can implement TCP over carrier pigeons, there are many
ways to implement these language features. For example, the ES6 spec defines
[lexical environments] as consisting of an [environment record] (roughly, the
local identifiers within a block) plus a link to an outer environment record,
allowing the nesting we have seen. The *logical rules* are nailed by the spec
(one hopes), but it's up to the implementation to translate them into bits and
bytes.

You can also inspect the assembly code produced by V8 for specific cases.
[Vyacheslav Egorov][egorov] has great posts and explains this process along with
V8 [closure internals][v8-closures] in detail. I've only started studying V8, so
pointers and corrections are welcome. If you know C#, inspecting the IL code
emitted for closures is enlightening - you will see the analog of V8 Contexts
explicitly defined and instantiated.

Closures are powerful beasts. They provide a succinct way to hide information
from a caller while sharing it among a set of functions.  I love that they
**truly hide** your data: unlike object fields, callers cannot access or even
*see* closed-over variables. Keeps the interface cleaner and safer.

But they're no silver bullet. Sometimes an object nut and a closure fanatic will
argue endlessly about their relative merits. Like most tech discussions, it's
often more about ego than real tradeoffs. At any rate, this [epic koan][koan] by
Anton van Straaten settles the issue:

{% blockquote Anton van Straaten http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg03277.html What's so cool about Scheme? %}
  The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton.  Hoping to
prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said "Master, I have heard that
objects are a very good thing - is this true?"  Qc Na looked pityingly at
his student and replied, "Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's
closures."

  Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell,
intent on studying closures.  He carefully read the entire "Lambda: The
Ultimate..." series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small
Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system.  He learned much, and
looked forward to informing his master of his progress.

  On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by
saying "Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand
that objects are truly a poor man's closures."  Qc Na responded by hitting
Anton with his stick, saying "When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's
object."  At that moment, Anton became enlightened.

And that closes our stack series. In the future I plan to cover other language
implementation topics like object binding and vtables. But the call of the
kernel is strong, so there's an OS post coming out tomorrow.  I invite you to
